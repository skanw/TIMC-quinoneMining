      "\t The family Streptomycetaceae, notably species in the genus Streptomyces, have long been the subject of investigation due to their well-known ability to produce secondary metabolites. The emergence of drug resistant pathogens and the relative ease of producing genome sequences has renewed the importance of Streptomyces as producers of new natural products and resulted in revived efforts in isolating and describing strains from novel environments. A previous large study of the phylogeny in the Streptomycetaceae based on 16S rRNA gene sequences provided a useful framework for the relationships among species, but did not always have sufficient resolution to provide definitive identification. Multi-locus sequence analysis of 5 house-keeping genes has been shown to provide improved taxonomic resolution of Streptomyces species in a number of previous reports so a comprehensive study was undertaken to evaluate evolutionary relationships among species within the family Streptomycetaceae where type strains are available in the ARS Culture Collection or genome sequences are available in GenBank. The results of the analysis supported the distinctiveness of Kitasatospora and Streptacidiphilus as validly named genera since they cluster outside of the phylogenetic radiation of the genus Streptomyces. There is also support for the transfer of a number of Streptomyces species to the genus Kitasatospora as well for reducing at least 31 species clusters to a single taxon. The multi-locus sequence database resulting from the study is a useful tool for identification of new isolates and the phylogenetic analysis presented also provides a road map for planning future genome sequencing efforts in the Streptomycetaceae.\n",
      "Nature of the interactions between hypocrealean fungi and the mutualistic fungus of leaf-cutter ants. \n",
      "\t Leaf-cutter ants cultivate and feed on the mutualistic fungus, Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, which is threatened by parasitic fungi of the genus Escovopsis. The mechanism of Escovopsis parasitism is poorly understood. Here, we assessed the nature of the antagonism of different Escovopsis species against its host. We also evaluated the potential antagonism of Escovopsioides, a recently described fungal genus from the attine ant environment whose role in the colonies of these insects is unknown. We performed dual-culture assays to assess the interactions between L. gongylophorus and both fungi. We also evaluated the antifungal activity of compounds secreted by the latter on L. gongylophorus growth using crude extracts of Escovopsis spp. and Escovopsioides nivea obtained either in (1) absence or (2) presence of the mutualistic fungus. The physical interaction between these fungi and the mutualistic fungus was examined under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Escovopsis spp. and E. nivea negatively affected the growth of L. gongylophorus, which was also significantly inhibited by both types of crude extract. These results indicate that Escovopsis spp. and E. nivea produce antifungal metabolites against the mutualistic fungus. SEM showed that Escovopsis spp. and E. nivea maintained physical contact with the mutualistic fungus, though no specialised structures related to mycoparasitism were observed. These results showed that Escovopsis is a destructive mycoparasite that needs physical contact for the death of the mutualistic fungus to occur. Also, our findings suggest that E. nivea is an antagonist of the ant fungal cultivar.\n",

      "\t Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens, a nitrogen-fixing endosymbiont of soybeans, is a model strain for studying rhizobial denitrification. This bacterium can also use nitrate as the sole nitrogen (N) source during aerobic growth by inducing an assimilatory nitrate reductase encoded by nasC located within the narK-bjgb-flp-nasC operon along with a nitrite reductase encoded by nirA at a different chromosomal locus. The global nitrogen two-component regulatory system NtrBC has been reported to coordinate the expression of key enzymes in nitrogen metabolism in several bacteria. In this study, we demonstrate that disruption of ntrC caused a growth defect in B. diazoefficiens cells in the presence of nitrate or nitrite as the sole N source and a decreased activity of the nitrate and nitrite reductase enzymes. Furthermore, the expression of narK-lacZ or nirA-lacZ transcriptional fusions was significantly reduced in the ntrC mutant after incubation under nitrate assimilation conditions.

      "Development of a regulatable expression system for the functional study of Vibrio vulnificus essential genes. \n",
      "\t We developed a regulatable gene expression system for Vibrio vulnificus, which contains a lacIq-pTrc cassette. Monomeric red fluorescence protein (mRFP) was used as a reporter to test this system. The results showed that this system tightly controlled the expression of mRFP without leaky expression and was suitable for the controlled expression of genes encoding recombinant proteins in V. vulnificus. To demonstrate the utility of this system, a dominant negative form of V. vulnificus VVMO6_RS04990, a homolog of Escherichia coli LolD that is essential in lipoprotein transport and membrane biogenesis, was inducibly expressed. Expression of the dominant negative LolD homolog, which has a mutation in the ATPase domain, resulted in a growth defect in V. vulnificus cells and impaired cell envelope stability. This result suggests that the V. vulnificus LolD homolog plays a role in cell envelope biogenesis. This tight and titratable expression system will therefore be a valuable tool for the study of essential genes in V. vulnificus.\n",
      "Development of an Indirect Dot-PPA-ELISA using glutamate dehydrogenase as a diagnostic antigen for the rapid and specific detection of Streptococcus suis and its application to clinical specimens. \n",
      "\t Streptococcus suis is an important zoonotic pathogen causing infections in pigs and humans. Bacterial surface-related proteins are often explored as potential vaccine candidates and diagnostic antigens. In the present study, glutamate dehydrogenase, a highly conserved immunogenic extracellular protein, was used to establish a dot horseradish peroxidase enzyme-linked staphylococcal protein A immunosorbent assay (Dot-PPA-ELISA) for diagnosis of S. suis infection. The antigen-antibody reaction was optimised through checkerboard titration involving serial dilutions, followed by selective blocking tests and evaluations of cross-reaction, repeatability, and stability. Comparative analysis by using a conventional plate ELISA kit showed that the specificity and sensitivity of the Dot-PPA-ELISA were 97.5 and 96.6%, respectively. Furthermore, dynamic changes in the levels of antibody in rabbits immunised with a propolis inactivated vaccine were monitored by Dot-PPA-ELISA. A total seroprevalence of 73.1% in 305 pig serum samples indicated the method's applicability to detect S. suis infection. Cumulatively, the results suggested that Dot-PAA-ELISA is a convenient, rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic method suitable for studying large numbers of samples obtained from clinical and epidemiological studies, thereby helping reduce important economic losses.\n",
      "Distinct bacterial communities across a gradient of vegetation from a preserved Brazilian Cerrado. \n",
      "\t The Cerrado biome in the Sete Cidades National Park, an Ecological Reserve in Northeastern Brazil, has conserved its native biodiversity and presents a variety of plants found in other savannas in Brazil. Despite this finding the soil microbial diversity and community structure are poorly understood. Therefore, we described soil bacterial diversity and distribution along a savanna vegetation gradient taking into account the prevailing environmental factors. The bacterial composition was retrieved by sequencing a fragment of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. The bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were assigned to 37 different phyla, 96 classes, and 83 genera. At the phylum level, a core comprised by Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes, was detected in all areas of Cerrado. 'Cerrado stricto sensu' and 'Cerradao' share more similarities between edaphic properties and vegetation and also present more similar bacterial communities, while 'Floresta decidual' and 'Campo graminoide' show the largest environmental differences and also more distinct bacterial communities. Proteobacteria (26%), Acidobacteria (21%) and Actinobacteria (21%) were the most abundant phyla within the four areas. All the samples present similar bacteria richness (alpha diversity) and the observed differences among them (beta diversity) were more related to the abundance of specific taxon OTUs compared to their presence or absence. Total organic C, N and P are the main abiotic factors structuring the bacterial communities. In summary, our findings show the bacterial community structure was clearly different across the Cerrado gradient, but that these environments share a bacterial phylum-core comprising Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes with other Brazilian savannas.\n",
      "Bioenergetics: the evolution of molecular mechanisms and the development of bioenergetic concepts. \n",
      "\t Possible routes for the evolution of cell energetics are considered. It is assumed that u.v. light was the primary energy source for the precursors of the primordial living cell and that primitive energetics might have been based on the use of the adenine moiety of ADP as the u.v. chromophore. It is proposed that the excitation of the adenine residue facilitated phosphorylation of its amino group with subsequent transfer of a phosphoryl group to the terminal phosphate of ADP to form ATP. ATP-driven carbohydrate synthesis is considered as a mechanism for storing u.v.-derived energy, which was then used in the dark. Glycolysis presumably produced compounds like ethanol and CO2, which easily penetrate the membrane and therefore were lost by the cell. Later lactate-producing glycolysis appeared, the end product being non-penetrant and, hence, retained inside the cell to be utilized to regenerate carbohydrates when light energy became available. Production of lactate was accompanied by accumulation of equimolar H+. To avoid acidification of the cell interior, an F0-type H+ channel was employed. Later it was supplemented with F1. This allowed the ATP energy to be used for 'uphill' H+ pumping to the medium, which was acidified due to glycolytic activity of the cells. In the subsequent course of evolution, u.v. light was replaced by visible light, which has lower energy but is less dangerous for the cell. It is assumed that bacteriorhodopsin, a simple and very stable light-driven H+ pump which still exists in halophilic and thermophilic Archaea, was the primary system utilizing visible light. The delta mu-H+ formed was used to reverse the H(+)-ATPase, which began to function as H(+)-ATP-synthase. Later, bacteriorhodopsin photosynthesis was substituted by a more efficient chlorophyll photosynthesis, producing not only ATP, but also carbohydrates. O2, a side product of this process, was consumed by the H(+)-motive respiratory chain to form delta mu-H+ in the dark. At the next stage of evolution, a parallel energy-transducing mechanism appeared which employed Na+ instead of H+ as the coupling ion (the Na+ cycle).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n",
      "Structure and evolution of cytochrome oxidase. \n",
      "\t The structural features of cytochrome oxidases are reviewed in light of their evolution. The substrate specificity (quinol vs. cytochrome c) is reflected in the presence of a unique copper centre (CuA) in cytochrome c oxidases. In several lines of evolution, quinol oxidases have independently lost this copper. Also, the most primitive cytochrome c oxidases do not contain this copper, and electron entry takes place via c-type haems. These enzymes, exemplified by the rhizobial FixN complex, probably remind the first oxidases. They are related to the denitrification enzyme nitric oxide reductase.\n",
      "Oxygen reactions with bacterial oxidases and globins: binding, reduction and regulation. \n",
      "\t Oxygen is favoured as terminal electron acceptor in aerobic and facultative microorganisms because of its appropriate physical state, satisfactory solubility and its desirable combinations of kinetic and thermodynamic properties. Oxygen is generally reduced by four electrons to yield oxygen, but there are important biological consequences of, and roles for, the partial reduction to superoxide and peroxide. Complex and multiple regulatory networks ensure (i) the utilization of oxygen in preference to other oxidants, (ii) the synthesis of oxygen-consuming enzymes with appropriate properties (particularly affinity for the ligand), and (iii) appropriate cellular protection in the event of oxidative stress. This contribution reviews the terminal respiratory oxidases of selected Gram-negative bacteria and microbial haemoglobin-like proteins. Recent studies of the cytochrome bd-type oxidases of Escherichia coli and Azotobacter vinelandii suggest that, despite probable similarity at the amino acid level, the reactivities of these oxidases with oxygen are strikingly different. The respiratory protection afforded to nitrogenase in the obligately aerobic diazotroph A. vinelandii by the cytochrome bd complex appears to be accompanied by, and may be the result of, a low affinity for oxygen and a high Vmax. The poorly characterized cytochrome o-containing oxidase in this bacterium is not required for respiratory protection. In E. coli, the cytochrome bd-type oxidase has a remarkably high affinity for oxygen, consistent with the view that this is an oxygen-scavenging oxidase utilized under microaerobic conditions. The demonstration of substrate (i.e. oxygen) inhibition in this complex suggests a mechanism whereby wasteful electron flux through a non-proton-pumping oxidase is avoided at higher dissolved oxygen tensions. The demonstration of two ligand-binding sites (haems d and b595) in oxidases of this type suggests plausible mechanisms for this phenomenon. In E. coli, assembly of the cytochrome bd-type oxidase (and of periplasmic cytochromes b and c) requires the presence of an ABC transporter, which may serve to export haem or some \"assembly factor\" to the periplasm. There is at least one additional oxygen-consuming protein in E. coli-the flavohaemoglobin encoded by the hmp gene. Globin-like proteins are also widely distributed in other bacteria, fungi and protozoa, but most have unknown functions. The function of HMP and the related chimaeric flavohaemoglobins in other bacteria and yeast is unknown; one of several possibilities for HMP is that its relatively low affinity for oxygen during turnover with NADH as substrate could enable it to function as a sensor of failing (or rising) cytoplasmic oxygen concentrations.\n",

      "Photobiology of bacteria. \n",
      "\t The field of photobiology is concerned with the interactions between light and living matter. For Bacteria this interaction serves three recognisable physiological functions: provision of energy, protection against excess radiation and signalling (for motility and gene expression). The chemical structure of the primary light-absorbing components in biology (the chromophores of photoactive proteins) is surprisingly simple: tetrapyrroles, polyenes and derivatised aromats are the most abundant ones. The same is true for the photochemistry that is catalysed by these chromophores: this is limited to light-induced exciton- or electron-transfer and photoisomerization. The apoproteins surrounding the chromophores provide them with the required specificity to function in various aspects of photosynthesis, photorepair, photoprotection and photosignalling. Particularly in photosynthesis several of these processes have been resolved in great detail, for others at best only a physiological description can be given. In this contribution we discuss selected examples from various parts of the field of photobiology of Bacteria. Most examples have been taken from the purple bacteria and the cyanobacteria, with special emphasis on recently characterised signalling photoreceptors in Ectothiorhodospira halophila and in Fremyella diplosiphon.\n",
      "Dissection of discrete kinetic events in the binding of antibiotics and substrates to the galactose-H+ symport protein, GalP, of Escherichia coli. \n",
      "\t GalP is the membrane protein responsible for H(+)-driven uptake of galactose into Escherichia coli. It is suggested to be the bacterial equivalent of the mammalian glucose transporter, GLUT1, since these proteins share sequence homology, recognise and transport similar substrates and are both inhibited by cytochalasin B and forskolin. The successful over-production of GalP to 35-55% of the total inner membrane protein of E. coli has allowed direct physical measurements on isolated membrane preparations. The binding of the antibiotics cytochalasin B and forskolin could be monitored from changes in the inherent fluorescence of GalP, enabling derivation of a kinetic mechanism describing the interaction between the ligands and GalP. The binding of sugars to GalP produces little or no change in the inherent fluorescence of the transporter. However, the binding of transported sugars to GalP produces a large increase in the fluorescence of 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulphonate (ANS) excited via tryptophan residues. This has allowed a binding step, in addition to two putative translocation steps, to be measured. From all these studies a basic kinetic mechanism for the transport cycle under non-energised conditions has been derived. The case of genetical manipulation of the galP gene in E. coli has been exploited to mutate individual amino acid residues that are predicted to play a critical role in transport activity and/or the recognition of substrates and antibiotics. Investigation of these mutant proteins using the fluorescence measurements should elucidate the role of individual residues in the transport cycle as well as refine the current model.\n",
      "A functional chimeric membrane subunit of an ion-translocating ATPase. \n",
      "\t A chimeric transport protein was made by expression of a fusion of the arsB genes from Escherichia coli plasmid R773 and Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258. The two genes were fused to encode a functional protein with first eight membrane spanning alpha-helices of the S. aureus and the last four helices of the E. coli protein. The hybrid protein provided arsenite resistance and transport. When an arsA gene was expressed in trans with the ArsB proteins encoded by the R773, pI258 and fusion genes, arsenite efflux was dependent on chemical but not electrochemical energy. The Ars system is hypothesized to be a novel transport system that functions as a primary ATP-driven pump or a secondary carrier, depending on the subunit composition of the complex.\n",
      "Solute transport and energy transduction in bacteria. \n",
      "\t In bacteria two forms of metabolic energy are usually present, i.e. ATP and transmembrane ion-gradients, that can be used to drive the various endergonic reactions associated with cellular growth. ATP can be formed directly in substrate level phosphorylation reactions whereas primary transport processes can generate the ion-gradients across the cytoplasmic membrane. The two forms of metabolic energy can be interconverted by the action of ion-translocating ATPases. For fermentative organisms it has long been thought that ion-gradients could only be generated at the expense of ATP hydrolysis by the F0F1-ATPase. In the present article, an overview is given of the various secondary transport processes that form ion-gradients at the expense of precursor (substrate) and/or end-product concentration gradients. The metabolic energy formed by these chemiosmotic circuits contributes to the 'energy status' of the bacterial cell which is particularly important for anaerobic/fermentative organisms.\n",
      "Bacterial sodium ion-coupled energetics. \n",
      "\t For many bacteria Na+ bioenergetics is important as a link between exergonic and endergonic reactions in the membrane. This article focusses on two primary Na+ pumps in bacteria, the Na(+)-translocating oxaloacetate decarboxylase of Klebsiella pneumoniae and the Na(+)-translocating F1Fo ATPase of Propionigenium modestum. Oxaloacetate decarboxylase is an essential enzyme of the citrate fermentation pathway and has the additional function to conserve the free energy of decarboxylation by conversion into a Na+ gradient. Oxaloacetate decarboxylase is composed of three different subunits and the related methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase consists of five different subunits. The genes encoding these enzymes have been cloned and sequenced. Remarkable are large areas of complete sequence identity in the integral membrane-bound beta-subunits including two conserved aspartates that may be important for Na+ translocation. The coupling ratio of the decarboxylase Na+ pumps depended on delta  muNa+ and decreased from two to zero Na+ uptake per decarboxylation event as delta  mu Na+ increased from zero to the steady state level. In P. modestum, delta  mu Na+ is generated in the course of succinate fermentation to propionate and CO2. This delta  mu Na+ is used by a unique Na(+)-translocating F1Fo ATPase for ATP synthesis. The enzyme is related to H(+)-translocating F1Fo ATPases. The Fo part is entirely responsible for the coupling of ion specificity. A hybrid ATPase formed by in vivo complementation of an Escherichia coli deletion mutant was completely functional as a Na(+)-ATP synthase conferring the E. coli strain the ability of Na(+)-dependent growth on succinate. The hybrid consisted of subunits a, c, b, delta and part of alpha from P. modestum and of the remaining subunits from E. coli. Studies on Na+ translocation through the Fo part of the P. modestum ATPase revealed typical transporter-like properties. Sodium ions specifically protected the ATPase from the modification of glutamate-65 in subunit c by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in a pH-dependent manner indicating that the Na+ binding site is at this highly conserved acidic amino acid residue of subunit c within the middle of the membrane.\n",

      "\t The amdS gene codes for an acetamidase enzyme that hydrolyses acetamide to acetate and ammonium thus providing A. nidulans with a source of carbon and nitrogen. The exceptionally favourable genetics of this system combined with molecular analysis have enabled many regulatory circuits affecting amdS to be identified genetically. Characterization of the regulatory genes and the definition of the cis-acting sites involved have been done using both in vivo and in vitro mutagenesis. Recent results on the analysis of the system are presented.\n",
      "In vitro transcription and binding analysis of promoter regulation by a host-specific signal in a phytopathogenic fungus. \n",
      "\t The PDA1 promoter of the phytopathogenNectria haematococca MPVI (anamorph Fusarium solani) offers a model for regulation of a fungal virulence gene in response to plant host-specific signals. Expression of the PDA1 gene, encoding pisatin demethylase, is induced in culture by pisatin, the isoflavanoid phytoalexin of pea. This pisatin induction is suppressed by nutritional factors. We have been studying the mechanism of pisatin induction through in vitro identification of regulatory factors and regulatory elements of the PDA1 promoter. We have developed an in vitro transcription system for N. haematococca which accurately initiates at the PDA1 promoter and reflects the pisatin induction of PDA1 mRNA observed in vivo. This in vitro activity allowed a functional test of a limited set of 5' upstream deletions in the PDA1 promoter. In vitro binding studies have identified a DNA binding factor which is appears in mycelial extract after treatment of the mycelium with pisatin. This pisatin-responsive factor binds to a minimum size region of 35 bp approximately 500 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. Tests using the in vitro transcription assay and in vivo competition both indicate a role for this binding region in the high expression of PDA1 under pisatin-induced conditions. Southwestern blotting has identified one component of this binding activity to be a approximately 35 kDa protein. The availability of these functional and structural tests of function, in conjunction with complementary in vivo tests, allow the detailed dissection of the signal pathway leading from exposure of the cell to pisatin towards the activation of PDA1 transcription.\n",

      "Population genetics of filamentous fungi. \n",
      "\t Population genetics aims to understand causes and consequences of the genetic structure of populations, i.e. distributions of genetic variants in space and time. Among the most important determinants of the genetic population structure is the genetic system itself, which is the collection of processes and mechanisms responsible for the transmission of genetic information. Filamentous fungi offer excellent opportunities for studying the effects of the genetic system on genetic population structure. Apart from their advantage as laboratory organisms, they exhibit a wide variety of genetic systems. In particular, their inherent capacity for anastomosis provides unique possibilities for investigating rates and consequences of horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, the temporary confinement of the products of meiosis in a common structure (the ascus) enables the study of competitive and antagonistic interactions between the meiotic products. An intriguing example of the latter is the phenomenon of 'spore killing', resulting in distorted meiotic segregation. This paper concentrates on population level research of the occurrence of vegetative incompatibility in Aspergillus and Neurospora species and to what extent this will inhibit horizontal transmission of genetic information, and on spore killing in Podospora anserina.\n",
      "Suppression of gene expression by homologous transgenes. \n",
      "\t When a wild-type strain of Neurospora crassa is transformed with different portions of the carotenogenic albino 1 or albino 3 genes, up to 30-35% of the transformants show an albino phenotype. The albino transformants presented a variety of phenotypes ranging from white or yellow to dark yellow colour. The ectopically integrated sequences provoke a severe impairment of the expression of the endogenous al-1 or al-3 genes. This phenomenon, that has been termed quelling, is found to be spontaneously and progressively reversible. In fact, all of the albino transformants have an unstable phenotype and revert progressively to wild type or intermediate phenotypes over a prolonged culturing time. The phenotypic reversion is characterised by a progressive release of the transcriptional inhibition and seems to correlate with the reduction of the number of the ectopic integrated sequences. However, there is no strict correlation between the copy number of the ectopic sequences and the intensity of quelling, as indicated by the existence of albino transformants containing only 1-2 ectopic sequences. The nature of the molecular events determining the onset of quelling is unclear, in any event, these are likely to involve some kind of interaction between the resident genes and ectopically integrated exogenous sequences. Recent evidences on a possible mechanism are presented.\n",
      "Protein targeting and secretion in filamentous fungi. A progress report. \n",
      "\t Although the application of filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus niger for the production of extracellular proteins is well established for several decades, hardly any information is available about the molecular mechanisms of the process of protein secretion in these organisms. Two lines of research initiated towards a systematic analysis of the mechanism of protein targeting and secretion are presented in this paper. 1--To study routing and targeting of proteins in filamentous fungi the availability of a versatile reporter/carrier protein will be of considerable importance. Experiments towards the identification of such a protein are presented. 2--In analogy to the situation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the availability of defined (conditional) mutations in the secretion pathway will provide very important information about the organisation of the pathway. Therefore, based on results obtained in S. cerevisiae, the cloning of several fungal 'secretion' genes was started. The results of the cloning and characterisation of one of these genes is presented.\n",

The strategies for yield improvement have included the use of strong homologous promoters, increased gene copy number, gene fusions with a gene encoding a naturally well-secreted protein, protease-deficient host strains and screening for high yields following random mutagenesis. Such approaches have been effective with some target heterologous proteins but not others. Approaches used in heterologous protein production from filamentous fungi are discussed and a perspective on emerging strategies is presented.\n",
      "Expression of genes and processing of enzymes for the biosynthesis of penicillins and cephalosporins. \n",
      "\t The genes pcbAB, pcbC and penDE encoding the enzymes (alpha-aminoadipyl-cysteinyl-valine synthetase, isopenicillin N synthase and isopenicillin N acyltransferase, respectively) involved in the biosynthesis of penicillin have been cloned from Penicillin chrysogenum and Aspergillus nidulans. They are clustered in chromosome I (10.4 Mb) of P. chrysogenum, in chromosome II of Penicillium notatum (9.6 Mb) and in chromosome VI (3.0 Mb) of A. nidulans. Each gene is expressed as a single transcript from separate promoters. Enzyme regulation studies and gene expression analysis have provided useful information to understand the control of genes involved in penicillin biosynthesis. The enzyme isopenicillin N acyltransferase encoded by the penDE gene is synthesized as a 40 kDa protein that is (self)processed into two subunits of 29 and 11 kDa. Both subunits appear to be required for acyl-CoA 6-APA acyltransferase activity. The isopenicillin N acyltransferase was shown to be located in microbodies, whereas the isopenicillin N synthase has been reported to be present in vesicles of the Golgi body and in the cell wall. A mutant in the carboxyl-terminal region of the isopenicillin N acyltransferase lacking the three final amino acids of the enzymes was not properly located in the microbodies and failed to synthesize penicillin in vivo. In C. acremonium the genes involved in cephalosporin biosynthesis are separated in at least two clusters. Cluster I (pcbAB-pcbC) encodes the first two enzymes (alpha-aminoadipyl-cysteinyl) valine synthetase and isopenicillin N synthase) of the cephalosporin pathway which are very similar to those involved in penicillin biosynthesis. Cluster II (cefEF-cefG), encodes the last three enzymatic activities (deacetoxycephalosporin C synthetase/hydroxylase and deacetylcephalosporin C acetyltransferase) of the cephalosporin pathway. It is unknown, at this time, if the cefD gene encoding isopenicillin epimerase is linked to any of these two clusters. Methionine stimulates cephalosporin biosynthesis in cultures of three different strains of A. chrysogenum. Methionine increases the levels of enzymes (isopenicillin N synthase and deacetylcephalosporin C acetyltransferase) expressed from genes (pcbC and cefG respectively) which are separated in the two different clusters of cephalosporin biosynthesis genes. This result suggests that both clusters of genes have regulatory elements which are activated by methionine. Methionine-supplemented cells showed higher levels of transcripts of the pcbAB, pcbC, cefEF genes and to a lesser extent of cefG than cells grown in absence of methionine. The levels of the cefG transcript were very low as compared to those of pcbAB, pcbC and cefEF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n",
      "Molecular genetics of Aspergillus pathogenicity. \n",
      "\t Aspergillus fumigatus is the most frequent cause of Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA), a life-threatening disease of immunosuppressed patients. In addition to a number of general physiological attributes of this fungus, it has been suggested that extracellular elastase and toxins might facilitate its growth in lung tissue. We have investigated the roles of two extracellular proteins, an alkaline protease with elastase activity (AFAlp), and the ribotoxin restrictocin in murine models of IPA. Gene disruption was used to create stable null mutant strains of the fungus lacking one or other protein, and their virulence and histopathological features were compared with an isogenic parental strain in steroid-treated and neutropenic mice. We have been unable to demonstrate any significant differences between the three strains, which shows that, considered independently, these proteins are not important virulence determinants. We are also interested in identifying fungal-specific gene products involved in general metabolism and which are required for growth in the lung, because these could represent new targets for antifungal drugs. For this work a model of murine IPA involving Aspergillus nidulans was established, to take advantage of the many well characterised mutations affecting metabolic pathways. Pathogenicity tests with strains carrying one of two auxotrophic mutations, lysA2 and pabaA1, have shown while lysine biosynthesis is not essential for the fungus to cause pulmonary disease, biosynthesis of p-aminobenzoic acid is essential. We are now in the process of cloning the A. fumigatus pabaA homologue to determine its function and whether this gene is required for growth of the clinically important species in the lung.\n",
      "Molecular communication between host plant and the fungal tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum. \n",
      "\t Host genotype specificity in interactions between biotrophic fungal pathogens and plants in most cases complies with the gene-for-gene model. Success or failure of infection is determined by absence or presence of complementary genes, avirulence and resistance genes, in the pathogen and the host plant, respectively. Resistance, expressed by the induction of a hypersensitive response followed by other defence responses in the host, is envisaged to be based on recognition of the pathogen, mediated through direct interaction between products of avirulence genes of the pathogen (the so-called race-specific elicitors) and receptors in the host plant, the putative products of resistance genes. The interaction between the biotrophic fungus Cladosporium fulvum and its only host tomato is a model system to study fungus-plant gene-for-gene relationships. Here we report on isolation, characterization and biological function of putative pathogenicity factors ECP1 and ECP2 and the race-specific elicitors AVR4 and AVR9 of C. fulvum and cloning and regulation of their encoding genes. Disruption of ecp1 and ecp2 genes has no clear effect on pathogenicity of C. fulvum. Disruption of the avr9 gene, which codes for the race-specific 28 amino acid AVR9 elicitor, in wild type avirulent races, leads to virulence on tomato genotypes carrying the complementary resistance gene Cf9. The avirulence gene avr4 encodes a 105 amino acid race-specific elicitor. A single basepair change in the avirulence gene avr4 leads to virulence on tomato genotypes carrying the Cf4 resistance gene.\n",
      "Location of pathogenicity genes on dispensable chromosomes in Nectria haematococca MPVI. \n",
      "\t Nectria haematococca MPVI can be found in many different biological habitats but has been most studied as a pathogen of pea (Pisum sativum). Genetic analyses of isolates obtained from a variety of biological sources has indicated that a number of genes control pathogenicity on pea but that one important PEa Pathogenicity (PEP) gene is PDA, which confers the ability to detoxify the pea phytoalexin pisatin. In these studies, all naturally occurring isolates that lacked PDA (i.e. Pda- isolates) and all Pda- progeny were essentially non-pathogenic on pea. However, we have demonstrated recently that Pda- mutants created by transformation-mediated gene disruptions, while having a modest reduction in virulence, and more virulent than any naturally occurring Pda- isolates. In addition we know that PDA genes are on dispensable (DS) chromosomes in this fungus. We believed that the gene disruption mutants have allowed the detection of other PEP genes that are present on the DS chromosomes along with PDA and that naturally occurring Pda- isolates usually lack this DS chromosome. This would explain why naturally occurring Pda- isolates are always low in virulence. We propose that the DS chromosomes in fungi are analogous to bacterial plasmids which allow those microorganisms to colonise different habitats, i.e. the DS chromosomes of Nectria haematococca contain genes that allow individual isolates of this broad host range pathogen to occupy different biological niches.\n",

Certain Cutibacterium acnes subtypes are associated with acne, although more than one subtype of C. acnes strains may simultaneously reside on the surface of the skin of an individual. To better understand the relationship between the genomic characteristics of C. acnes subtypes and acnes, we collected 50 C. acnes strains from the facial skin of 10 people (5 healthy individuals, 5 patients with acne) in Liaoning, China and performed whole genome sequencing of all strains. We demonstrated that the six potential pathogenic C. acnes strains were all Type II subtype, and discovered 90 unique genes of the six strains related to acne using pan-genome analysis. The distribution of 2 of the 90 genes was identified by PCR in bacterial cultures collected from the facial skin of 171 individuals (55 healthy individuals, 52 patients with mild acne and 64 patients with moderate to severe acne). Both the genes were significantly associated with acne (Chi square test, P < 0.01). We conclude that Type II strains are associated with acne in Chinese patients.\n",

The open reading frame of the gene consisted of 1422 bp and was deduced to contain 472 amino acids with a molecular mass of 52 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited greater than 45% identity with that of prokaryotic D-hydantoinases and eukaryotic DHPs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Bacillus sp. TS-23 DHP is grouped together with Bacillus stearothermophilus D-hydantoinase and related to dihydroorotases and allantoinases from various organisms. His6-tagged DHP was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography to a specific activity of 3.46 U mg(-1) protein. The optimal pH and temperature for the purified enzyme were 8.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The half-life of His6-tagged DHP was 25 days at 50 degrees C. The enzyme activity was stimulated by Co2+ and Mn2+ ions. His6-tagged DHP was most active toward dihydrouracil followed by hydantoin derivatives. The catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of the enzyme for dihydrouracil and hydantoin were 2.58 and 0.61 s(-1) mM(-1), respectively.\n",
      "Cellular lipid fatty acid pattern heterogeneity between reference and recent food isolates of Listeria monocytogenes as a response to cold stress. \n",
      "\t Cells of four reference strains (Scott A, LO 28, CNL 895807 and ATCC 19115) and of five recent food isolates (A00M011, A00M018, A00M087, A00M092 and A00M123) of Listeria monocytogenes were grown until late exponential phase in Brain Heart Broth at two different temperatures (37 degrees C and 4 degrees C). Our results show that significant differences exist between the cellular lipid fatty acid profile of reference and recent food isolates. Like the reference strains, and in keeping with previous reports on the cellular lipid fatty acid profile of L. monocytogenes, the recent food isolates were characterised by the presence of ai15:0, i15:0 and ai17:0. In addition, the fatty acid ai13:0 was observed in all of the recent food isolates grown at 4 degrees C, whereas only two reference strains, Scott A and LO 28, showed ai13:0 in their cellular lipid fatty acid profile at 4 degrees C. When grown at 4 degrees C, the recent food isolates showed a mean aiC15/aiC17 ratio of 66, while reference strains were characterised by significantly lower ratios, ranging between 4.3 (ATCC 19115) and 28.9 (Scott A). These results showed that all of the recent food isolates, Scott A and LO28 strains use chain length and anteiso-branching (ai15:0) as their major response to cold temperature adaptation. However, the cold adaptation response of reference strains CNL 895807 and ATCC 19115 appears to be different.\n",

      "\t The cell surface properties of human intestinal bifidobacteria have been characterized for 30 strains isolated from a fecal sample. Strain identification to the species level was obtained by restriction analysis of the amplified 16S rRNA gene and confirmed by DNA/DNA reassociation experiments. The isolates were grouped in four genetically homogeneous clusters whose members belonged to Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum species. Cell surface properties of Bifidobacterium strains were evaluated by determining the level of hydrophobicity, adhesion to hydrocarbons and contact angle measurements, and their autoaggregation ability. The results showed high and homogeneous level of hydrophobicity in all tested strains when contact angle measurements values were considered. On the contrary, autoaggregation assays and bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons detected interesting differences in cell surface properties among the tested Bifidobacterium strains. The highest levels of autoaggregation, detected in B. bifidum and B. adolescentis strains, were strictly dependent on the pH of the medium. Moreover, protease treatment experiments suggested that proteins had a key role in the autoaggregating ability of B. bifidum and B. adolescentis strains.\n",

      "\t A membrane fraction obtained from the filamentous form of Sporothrix schenckii was able to transfer mannose from GDP-Mannose into dolichol phosphate mannose and from this inTermediate into mannoproteins in coupled reactions catalyzed by dolichol phosphate mannose synthase and protein mannosyl transferase(s), respectively. Although the transfer reaction depended on exogenous dolichol monophosphate, membranes failed to use exogenous dolichol phosphate mannose for protein mannosylation to a substantial extent. Over 95% of the sugar was transferred to proteins via dolichol phosphate mannose and the reaction was stimulated several fold by Mg2+ and Mn2+. Incubation of membranes with detergents such as Brij 35 and Lubrol PX released soluble fractions that transferred the sugar from GDP-Mannose mostly into mannoproteins, which were separated by affinity chromatography on Concanavilin A-Sepharose 4B into lectin-reacting and non-reacting fractions. All proteins mannosylated in vitro eluted with the lectin-reacting proteins and analytical electrophoresis of this fraction revealed the presence of at least nine putative mannoproteins with molecular masses in the range of 26-112 kDa. The experimental approach described here can be used to identify and isolate specific glycoproteins mannosylated in vitro in studies of O-glycosylation.\n",

Physical maps of the mtDNA of the IFM5844 (var. neoformans) and IFO410 (var. grubii) strains were constructed by using EcoRI and EcoRV restriction enzymes; functional maps were constructed by hybridization, cloning and sequencing. Most of the genes important in the mitochondrial function (ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, ND5, ND6, ATP6, ATP9, COX1, COX2 and COB) and protein synthesis (SsrRNA and LsrRNA) were localized. We did not find any differences between the strains in the order of these genes. However, they differed significantly in the sizes of the mtDNAs: 32.6 kb for IFM5844, and 24.1 kb for IFO410. This can be attributed to two large regions of the mtDNA. In these regions, differences were found in the numbers of introns in COX1 (no intron in var. grubii, 5 introns in var. neoformans), COB (1 intron in var. grubii, 2 introns in var. neoformans), LsrRNA (no intron in var. grubii, 2 introns in var. neoformans), and ND5 (no intron in var. grubii, 1 intron in var. neoformans) genes. In several introns of the COB and COX1 genes LAGLIDADG motifs were found. Differences were also observed in the nucleotide sequences of some genes and in the sizes and sequences of intergenic regions. The nucleotide sequences of the genes of the IFM and IFO strains were compared with those of the H-99 and JEC 21 strains from the database. Surprisingly high similarities were found between the strains belonging in var. grubii (IFO 410 and H-99) and var. neoformans (IFM 5844 and JEC 21).\n",

      "\t We evaluated the morphology of typical and atypical Paracoccidioides brasiliensis strains and the expression of its 43 kDa glycoprotein (GP43). Strains of P. brasiliensis preserved under mineral oil for long periods of time presented different morphological patterns on peptone, yeast-extract and glucose (PYG) agar. The intravenous inoculation in BALB/c mice confirmed that a strain bearing morphological alterations was non-virulent. In contrast, another strain also maintained under mineral oil but which did not exhibit such morphological dysfunction was as virulent as the well characterized Pb 339 and Pb 18 strains. The expression of the main antigen expressed by P. brasiliensis, GP43, was assessed in culture filtrates by western immunoblots. Typical and atypical strains were capable of secreting the glycoprotein, except strain Pb IOC 1059. The identity of the atypical strains was confirmed by PCR using specific primers for gp43, though the single PCR-fragment varied in size for the atypical strains. The PCR fragments from an atypical strain, Pb IOC 1210, and the typical Pb 339 and Pb IOC 3698 strains were sequenced and blasted to the gp43 gene from the Pb 18 strain (GenBank AY005429). These results ensured the identity of the atypical strains as P. brasiliensis, and suggested a relationship between the alteration of morphological differentiation and the virulence factor following storage under mineral oil.\n",

Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain C34(T) formed a distinct phyletic line in the Streptomyces gene tree that was very loosely associated with the type strains of several Streptomyces species. Multilocus sequence analysis based on five house-keeping gene alleles underpinned the separation of strain C34(T) from all of its nearest phylogenetic neighbours, apart from Streptomyces chiangmaiensis TA-1(T) and Streptomyces hyderabadensis OU-40(T) which are not currently in the MLSA database.

      "\t A halophilic archaeon, designed strain CBA1103(T), was isolated from non-purified solar salt. The cells of strain CBA1103(T) were observed to be Gram-stain negative and pleomorphic, and the colonies appear red. Strain CBA1103(T) was observed to grow between 20 and 55 °C (optimum 37 °C), and in NaCl concentrations of 10-30 % (w/v) (optimum 15 %) with 0-0.5 M MgSO4·7H2O (optimum 0.1 M) and at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0). Additionally, the cells lyse in distilled water. The major polar lipids of strain CBA1103(T) are phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester, phosphatidylglycerol sulfate and two glycolipids chromatographically identical to sulfated mannosyl glucosyl diether and manosyl glucosyl diether. Strain CBA1103(T) is shown to belong to the Halobellus genus and exhibits similarity to related taxa; the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain CBA1103(T) and Halobellus rarus 18362(T), Hbs. limi 16811(T), Hbs. litoreus JCM 17118(T), Hbs. inordinatus YC20(T), Hbs. clavatus TNN18(T) and Hbs. salinus CSW2.24.4(T) is 97.3, 96.5, 96.5, 94.5, 94.5 and 93.7 %, respectively. The RNA polymerase subunit B gene sequence of strain CBA1103(T) shows 93.7 % similarity with the sequence of Hbs. litoreus JCM 17118(T); the similarity is lower with sequences from the type strains of other species of Halobellus. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain CBA1103(T) was determined to be 67.0 mol% a value which is in the range of the genomic DNA G+C content of members of the genus Halobellus (61.5-69.2 mol%). These results suggest that strain CBA1103(T) should be considered to represent a new taxon for which the name Halobellus rufus sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain CBA1103(T) (=CECT 8423(T) =JCM 19434(T)). \n",
      "Lipopeptides from Bacillus strain AR2 inhibits biofilm formation by Candida albicans. \n",
      "\t The ability of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans to reversibly switch between different morphological forms and establish biofilms is crucial for establishing infection. Targeting phenotypic plasticity and biofilm formation in C. albicans represents a new concept for antifungal drug discovery. The present study evaluated the influence of cyclic lipopeptide biosurfactant produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AR2 on C. albicans biofilms. The biosurfactant was characterized as a mixture of iturin and fengycin by MALDI-TOF and amino acid analysis. The biosurfactant exhibited concentration dependent growth inhibition and fungicidal activity. The biosurfactant at sub-minimum growth inhibition concentration decreased cell surface hydrophobicity, hindered germ tube formation and reduced the mRNA expression of hyphae-specific gene HWP1 and ALS3 without exhibiting significant growth inhibition. The biosurfactants inhibited biofilm formation in the range of 46-100 % depending upon the concentration and Candida strains. The biosurfactant treatment dislodged 25-100 % of preformed biofilm from polystyrene plates. The biosurfactant retained its antifungal and antibiofilm activity even after exposure to extreme temperature. By virtue of the ability to inhibit germ tube and biofilm formation, two important traits of C. albicans involved in establishing infection, lipopeptides from strain AR2 may represent a potential candidate for developing heat stable anti-Candida drugs. \n",
      "Genomics and phylogeny of the proposed phylum 'Candidatus Poribacteria' associated with the excavating sponge Thoosa mismalolli. \n",
      "\t Members of the proposed phylum 'Candidatus Poribacteria' are among the most abundant microorganisms in the highly diverse microbiome of the sponge mesohyl. Genomic and phylogenetic characteristics of this proposed phylum are barely known. In this study, we analyzed metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) obtained from the coral reef excavating sponge Thoosa mismalolli from the Mexican Pacific Ocean. Two MAGs were extracted and analyzed together with 32 MAGs and single-amplified genomes (SAGs) obtained from NCBI. The phylogenetic tree based on the sequences of 139 single-copy genes (SCG) showed two clades. Clade A (23 genomes) represented 67.7% of the total of the genomes, while clade B (11 genomes) comprised 32.3% of the genomes. The Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) showed values between 66 and 99% for the genomes of the proposed phylum, and the pangenome of genomes revealed a total of 37,234 genes that included 1722 core gene. The number of genes used in the phylogenetic analysis increased from 28 (previous studies) to 139 (this study), which allowed a better resolution of the phylogeny of the proposed phylum. The results supported the two previously described classes, 'Candidatus Entoporibacteria' and 'Candidatus Pelagiporibacteria', and the genomes SB0101 and SB0202 obtained in this study belong to two new species of the class 'Candidatus Entoporibacteria'. This is the first comparative study that includes MAGs from a non-sponge host (Porites lutea) to elucidate the taxonomy of the poorly known Candidatus phylum in a polyphasic approach. Finally, our study also contributes to the sponge microbiome project by reporting the first MAGs of the proposed phylum 'Candidatus Poribacteria' isolated from the excavating sponge T. mismalolli.\n",

      "Transient excretion of succinate from Trichoderma atroviride submerged mycelia reveals the complex movements and metabolism of carboxylates. \n",
      "\t Submerged growth of Trichoderma atroviride CCM F 534 on glucose-containing medium was accompanied by the excretion of organic acids (succinate, citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, fumarate, aconitate). The excretion of succinate was transient. After 48-72 h cultivation, millimolar amounts of succinate disappeared from the medium. We studied the mechanism of the removal of succinate from the medium and demonstrated the activation of the inward transport of succinate by submerged mycelia. This transport was carrier-mediated, had a low solute specificity, and was driven by proton-motive force. The last aspect was provided by the activation of the H(+)-ATPase, as documented by measurements of ATPase activity and expression of the pma gene. The disruption of the pma gene abolished the capacity of the mycelia to re-uptake succinate but not its production. Results show that excreted carboxylates could serve as alternative nutrients in the late phase(s) of submerged growth, explain why inward transport system(s) for carboxylates are induced, and indicate that the inward-directed transport could interfere with the production of carboxylic acids by fungi.\n",

      "\t An agarolytic bacterium, designated as strain M5c(T), was isolated from sea sand in Jeju Island, Korea.

      "The ability to use nitrate confers advantage to Dekkera bruxellensis over S. cerevisiae and can explain its adaptation to industrial fermentation processes. \n",
      "\t The yeast Dekkera bruxellensis has been regarded as a contamination problem in industrial ethanol production because it can replace the originally inoculated Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The present study deals with the influence of nitrate on the relative competitiveness of D. bruxellensis and S. cerevisiae in sugar cane ethanol fermentations. The industrial strain D. bruxellensis GDB 248 showed higher growth rates than S. cerevisiae JP1 strain in mixed ammonia/nitrate media, and nitrate assimilation genes were only slightly repressed by ammonia. These characteristics rendered D. bruxellensis cells with an ability to overcome S. cerevisiae populations in both synthetic medium and in sugar cane juice. The results were corroborated by data from industrial fermentations that showed a correlation between high nitrate concentrations and high D. bruxellensis cell counts. Moreover, the presence of nitrate increased fermentation efficiency of D. bruxellensis cells in anaerobic conditions, which may explain the maintenance of ethanol production in the presence of D. bruxellensis in industrial processes. The presence of high levels of nitrate in sugar cane juice may be due to its inefficient conversion by plant metabolism in certain soil types and could explain the periodical episodes of D. bruxellensis colonization of Brazilian ethanol plants.\n",

      "\t Frenulates are a group of gutless marine annelids belonging to the Siboglinidae that are nutritionally dependent upon endosymbiotic bacteria. We have characterized the bacteria associated with several frenulate species from mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz by PCR-DGGE of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, coupled with analysis of 16S rRNA gene libraries. In addition to the primary symbiont, bacterial consortia (microflora) were found in all species analysed. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the primary symbiont in most cases belongs to the Gammaproteobacteria and were related to thiotrophic and methanotrophic symbionts from other marine invertebrates, whereas members of the microflora were related to multiple bacterial phyla. This is the first molecular evidence of methanotrophic bacteria in at least one frenulate species. In addition, the occurrence of the same bacterial phylotype in different Frenulata species, from different depths and mud volcanoes suggests that there is no selection for specific symbionts and corroborates environmental acquisition as previously proposed for this group of siboglinids.\n",

Strains Mo39, MARY089 and CBS 5307, respectively, isolated from an unidentified deep-sea coral collected near Rainbow hydrothermal vent, from water samples near Menez Gwen hydrothermal field and from the stomach of a marine fish are considered as a novel taxon. Sequence similarities in the D1/D2 region of the 26S rRNA gene indicated that strains Mo39, MARY089 and CBS 5307 have for closest neighbors Candida spencermartinsiae, Candida taylorii, Candida atmosphaerica and Candida atlantica. The strains, respectively, differ from C. spencermartinsiae, C. taylorii, C. atmosphaerica andCandida atlantica by 4, 4.3, 4.3 and 4.7% in the D1/D2 domain. Strains Mo39, MARY089 and CBS 5307 were differentiated from others by differences in the ability to assimilate D: -Gluconate and in the ability to grow at relatively high temperature. Only strain Mo39 displays an optimal growth at 3% sea salts, indicating that this strain is clearly adapted to live in marine conditions. Sequence similarities between strains Mo39, MARY089 and CBS 5307 and related species and differences in the ability to utilize specific carbon compounds revealed that these strains represent a hitherto unknown species. Sexual reproduction was not observed in strains Mo39, MARY089 and CBS 5307.

      "Mercury and methylmercury detoxification potential by sponge-associated bacteria. \n",
      "\t Ionic and organic forms of mercury (Hg) are powerful cytotoxic and neurotoxic agents in both humans and wild life. The aim of this study was to analyze the resistance profile and potential detoxification of inorganic and organic forms of Hg of bacteria isolated from marine sponges on the coast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Out of the 1,236 colony forming units associated with eleven species of marine sponges, 100 morphologically different bacterial strains were analyzed in this study. Of these, 21 strains were resistant to Hg, 14 of which were classified as highly resistant because they grew despite exposure to 100 µM HgCl2. Fifteen resistant strains reduced Hg and presented merA in their genomes. The remaining six strains produced biosurfactants, suggesting that they may tolerate Hg by sequestration. Eleven strains grew in the presence of methylmercury. Our results suggest a potential for mercury detoxification by marine sponge-associated resistant bacteria, either through reduction or sequestration, as well as the possibility of bioremediation of toxic waste containing mercury.\n",
      "Sympatric metabolic diversification of experimentally evolved Escherichia coli in a complex environment. \n",
      "\t Sympatric diversification in bacteria has been found to contravene initial evolutionary theories affirming the selection of the fittest type by competition for the same resource. Studies in unstructured (well-mixed) environments have discovered divergence of an ancestor strain into genomically and phenotypically divergent types growing both on single and mixed energy sources. This study addresses the metabolic diversification in an Escherichia coli population that evolved over ~1,000 generations under aerobic conditions in the nutritional complexity offered by Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. The medium lacked glucose but contained a variety of other resources. Two distinct metabolically-diverged types, coinciding with colony morphologies, were found to dominate the populations. One type was an avid carbohydrate consumer, which could quickly utilize the available (alternative) substrates feeding into glycolysis. The second type was a slow grower, which was able to specifically consume acetate. The capacity to utilize acetate might be providing an advantage to this second type, suggesting an increased capability to deal with adverse conditions that occur in the later stages of growth. The diverged metabolic preferences of the two forms suggested differential and interactive ecological roles within the population. We postulate that these types used different alternative metabolic strategies occupying different niches in a sympatric manner as an outcome of adaptation to the complex environment. \n",

      "Origin of diderm (Gram-negative) bacteria: antibiotic selection pressure rather than endosymbiosis likely led to the evolution of bacterial cells with two membranes. \n",
      "\t The prokaryotic organisms can be divided into two main groups depending upon whether their cell envelopes contain one membrane (monoderms) or two membranes (diderms). It is important to understand how these and other variations that are observed in the cell envelopes of prokaryotic organisms have originated. In 2009, James Lake proposed that cells with two membranes (primarily Gram-negative bacteria) originated from an ancient endosymbiotic event involving an Actinobacteria and a Clostridia (Lake 2009). However, this Perspective argues that this proposal is based on a number of incorrect assumptions and the data presented in support of this model are also of questionable nature. Thus, there is no reliable evidence to support the endosymbiotic origin of double membrane bacteria. In contrast, many observations suggest that antibiotic selection pressure was an important selective force in prokaryotic evolution and that it likely played a central role in the evolution of diderm (Gram-negative) bacteria. Some bacterial phyla, such as Deinococcus-Thermus, which lack lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and yet contain some characteristics of the diderm bacteria, are postulated as evolutionary intermediates (simple diderms) in the transition between the monoderm bacterial taxa and the bacterial groups that have the archetypal LPS-containing outer cell membrane found in Gram-negative bacteria. It is possible to distinguish the two stages in the evolution of diderm-LPS cells (viz. monoderm bacteria → simple diderms lacking LPS → LPS containing archetypal diderm bacteria) by means of conserved inserts in the Hsp70 and Hsp60 proteins. The insert in the Hsp60 protein also distinguishes the traditional Gram-negative diderm bacterial phyla from atypical taxa of diderm bacteria (viz. Negativicutes, Fusobacteria, Synergistetes and Elusimicrobia). The Gram-negative bacterial phyla with an LPS-diderm cell envelope, as defined by the presence of the Hsp60 insert, are indicated to form a monophyletic clade and no loss of the outer membrane from any species from this group seems to have occurred. This argues against the origin of monoderm prokaryotes from diderm bacteria by loss of outer membrane.\n",
      "Geographical markers for Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with similar technological origins domesticated for rice-based ethnic fermented beverages production in North East India. \n",
      "\t Autochthonous strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from traditional starters used for the production of rice-based ethnic fermented beverage in North East India were examined for their genetic polymorphism using mitochondrial DNA-RFLP and electrophoretic karyotyping. Mitochondrial DNA-RFLP analysis of S. cerevisiae strains with similar technological origins from hamei starter of Manipur and marcha starter of Sikkim revealed widely separated clusters based on their geographical origin. Electrophoretic karyotyping showed high polymorphism amongst the hamei strains within similar mitochondrial DNA-RFLP cluster and one unique karyotype of marcha strain was widely distributed in the Sikkim-Himalayan region. We conceptualized the possibility of separate domestication events for hamei strains in Manipur (located in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot) and marcha strains in Sikkim (located in Himalayan biodiversity hotspot), as a consequence of less homogeneity in the genomic structure between these two groups, their clear separation being based on geographical origin, but  not on technological origin and low strain level diversity within each group. The molecular markers developed based on HinfI-mtDNA-RFLP profile and the chromosomal doublets in chromosome VIII position of Sikkim-Himalayan strains could be effectively used as geographical markers for authenticating the above starter strains and differentiating them from other commercial strains.\n",

      "\t In the present study the diversity and abundance of nitrifying microbes including ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and betaproteobacteria (beta-AOB) were investigated, along with the physicochemical parameters potentially affecting them, in a transect of surface sediments from the coastal margin adjacent to the Pearl River estuary to the slope in the deep South China Sea. Nitrifying microbial diversity was determined by detecting the amoA (ammonia monooxygenase subunit A) gene. An obvious community structure shift for both AOA and beta-AOB from the coastal marginal areas to the slope in the deep-sea was detected, while the OTU numbers of AOA amoA were more stable than those of the beta-AOB. The OTUs of beta-AOB increased with the distance from the coastal margin areas to the slope in the deep-sea. Beta-AOB showed lower diversity with dominant strains in a polluted area but higher diversity without dominant strains in a clean area. Moreover, the diversity of beta-AOB was correlated with pH values, while no noticeable relationships were established between AOA and physicochemical parameters. Beta-AOB was more sensitive to transect environmental variability and might be a potential indicator for environmental changes. Additionally, the surface sediments surveyed in the South China Sea harboured diverse and distinct AOA and beta-AOB phylotypes different from other environments, suggesting the endemicity of some nitrifying prokaryotes in the South China Sea.\n",

      "\t A multi-faceted screening programme was designed to search for the oxidases, laccase, peroxidase and tyrosinase. Actinobacteria were selectively isolated from the paunch and colon region of the hindguts of the higher termite, Amitermes hastatus. The isolates were subjected to solid media assays (dye decolourization, melanin production and the utilization of indulin AT as sole carbon source) and liquid media assays. Eleven of the 39 strains had the ability to decolourize the dye RBBR, an indicator for the production of peroxidases in actinobacteria. Melanin production on ISP6 and ISP7 agar plates served as a good indicator for laccase and/or tyrosinase production and the ability of the strains to grow in the presence of indulin AT as a sole carbon source served as a good indicator of lignin peroxidase and/or general peroxidase production. Enzyme-producing strains were cultivated in liquid media and extracellular enzyme activities measured. Strains with the ability to produce oxidative enzymes under the conditions tested were identified to genus level by 16S rRNA gene analysis and compared to known oxidase producers. A strong relationship was observed between the environment sampled (termite guts where lignocellulose degradation occurs) and the dominant type of oxidative enzyme activity detected (laccases and peroxidases), which suggests the possibility of future targeted screening protocols linking the physical properties of the target enzymes with specific operational conditions required, such as lignocellulosic degradation in the preparation of biofuel feedstocks.\n",

The main properties evaluated were: intensity of the Crabtree effect, specific growth rate, biomass yield on substrate, metabolite excretion and protein secretion capacity, inferred by measuring extracellular inulinase activity. The strain Kluyveromyces lactis CBS 2359 was evaluated in parallel, since it is the best described Kluyveromyces yeast and thus can be used as a control for the experimental setup.

      "\t Streptomyces vietnamensis, a recently designated species isolated from tropical forest soil, was found to be a new granaticin producer. The granaticin biosynthetic gene cluster (gra) and flanking genes from S. vietnamensis were cloned and sequenced by a sequential cloning strategy. All biosynthetic genes were found as expected. The high overall homology of the gra cluster from S. vietnamensis to that of Streptomyces violaceoruber Tü22 indicated a recent common ancestor of the two clusters. However, a flanking gene orf35 was missing from the gra cluster of S. vietnamensis, and high frequency of insertions and deletions of short fragment (shorter than 63 bp) were observed throughout the sequenced region compared to that of S. violaceoruber Tü22. These revealed a rapid evolution of the gra cluster and suggested that small insertions and deletions might be one of the basic evolution mechanisms for streptomycete genomes. The phylogenetic incongruence between 16S rDNA and the gra cluster and the scattered distribution of the granaticin producers within Streptomyces implicated horizontal gene transfer (HGT) being involved in the gra cluster dispersion. The remnants of orf35 found in S. vietnamensis present a scenario on how the antibiotic gene clusters evolved after HGT. The contemporary gra cluster residing in S. vietnamensis could be interpreted as a combination of HGT and highly variable vertical transmission.\n",

Qualitative analysis of the induced compounds using reverse phase HPLC and further confirmation with LC-MS/MS showed consistent accumulation of phenolic acids (gallic, gentisic, caffeic, chlorogenic and ferulic acids), flavonoids (rutin and quercetin) and phytohormones (indole acetic acid and indole butyric acid) in rice leaves. Plant growth promotion (shoot, root length and biomass) was positively correlated with total protein and chlorophyll content of leaves. Enzyme activity of peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase and total phenolic content was fairly high in rice leaves inoculated with O. acuta and P. boryanum after 30 days. Differential systemic accumulation of phenylpropanoids in plant leaves led us to conclude that cyanobacterial inoculation correlates positively with plant growth promotion and stress tolerance in rice. Furthermore, the study helped in deciphering possible mechanisms underlying plant growth promotion and stress tolerance in rice following cyanobacterial inoculation and indicated the less explored avenue of cyanobacterial colonization in stress tolerance against abiotic stress.\n",

Here we show that actP gene expression is down-regulated by fructose and this in turn determines a strong decrease of tellurite uptake and a parallel increase in the cells resistance to the toxic metalloid (from a minimal inhibitory concentration of 8 μM up to 400 μM tellurite under aerobic growth conditions). This demonstrates that there exists a direct connection between the level of tellurite uptake and the sensitivity of the cells to the oxyanion.\n",

      "\t This paper presents an analysis of the protective properties of the components in ribonuclease (RNase)-sensitive ribosomal vaccines, in particular the ribonucleic acid (RNA). The protective activities in mice of purified ribosomes derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and from Listeria monocytogenes were compared. Both ribosomal vaccines had to be combined with the adjuvant dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA) in order to be protective, and both lost their activity after RNase treatment. The ribosomal vaccines as well as RNA purified from the ribosomes induced non-specific protection. Intraperitoneal injection of RNA with DDA induced an influx of peritoneal cells. Furthermore, RNA with DDA activated macrophages as shown by, a.o., enhanced phagocytic activity and killing capacity for L. monocytogenes. The results suggest that the observed macrophage activation is probably T-cell-independent. With regard to the ribosomal vaccine of P. aeruginosa it is concluded that RNA also contributed to the protective activity by increasing the humoral response against suboptimal concentrations of contaminating cell surface antigens. In conclusion, it is proposed that ribosomal vaccines may be considered as a combination of a non-specific immunomodulator (RNA) with pathogen-specific cell surface antigens. This concept of ribosomal vaccines is discussed in relation to the literature concerning RNase-sensitive ribosomal vaccines.\n",
      "Phylogenetic assignment and mechanism of action of a crop growth promoting Rhizobium radiobacter strain used as a biofertiliser on graminaceous crops in Russia. \n",
      "\t The taxonomic position of \"Agrobacterium radiobacter strain 204,\" used in Russia as a cereal crop growth promoting inoculant, was derived by a polyphasic approach. The phenotypic analyses gave very similar biochemical profiles for strain 204, Rhizobium radiobacter NCIMB 9042 (formerly the A. radiobacter type strain) and R. radiobacter NCIMB 13307 (formerly the Agrobacterium tumefaciens type strain). High percentage similarities, above the species separation level, were observed between the 16S rRNA, fusA and rpoB housekeeping gene sequences of these three strains, and the genomic DNA-DNA hybridisation of strain 204 against the type strain of R. radiobacter NCIMB 9042 was over 70%. Strain 204 is not phytopathogenic and it does not fix atmospheric N2 or form a physical association with the roots of barley. Strain 204 culture and culture supernatant stimulated the rate of mobilisation of seed reserves of barley in darkness and promoted its shoot growth in the light. Gibberellic acid (GA) concentration was 1.3 microM but indole acetic acid was undetectable (< 50 nM) in cultures of strain 204. It is concluded that strain 204 is phenotypically and genotypically very similar to the current R. radiobacter type strain and that the mechanism of its effect on growth of cereals is via the production of plant growth promoting substances. GA is likely to play an important role in the strain 204 stimulation of early growth of barley.\n",
      "Isolation of aminopeptidase N genes of food associated propionibacteria and observation of their transcription in skim milk and acid whey. \n",
      "\t In this study consensus oligonucleotides PN5/PN3 were designed by aligning the aminopeptidase N genes (pepN) of various actinobacteria and applied to the isolation of the pepN genes of dairy propionibacteria (PAB) and closely related species associated with food. This allowed sequencing of a pepN gene region from Propionibacterium jensenii LMG 16541. The sequence of this gene was completed by inverse PCR. Consensus primer pairs NU1/D1 and NU2/D1 were derived from the alignment of the new sequence with its homologues in Propionibacterium acnes and other actinobacteria; these were used to start sequencing of the pepN genes of Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium thoenii, Propionibacterium microaerophilum, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propioni bacterium cyclohexanicum and Propionibacterium microaerophilum. Reverse transcription coupled with PN5/PN3 and NU1/D1 PCR tests indicated that the pepN genes of P. jensenii and P. freudenreichii are expressed during growth in skim milk and acid whey.\n",

      "\t Extracellular laccase from Panus tigrinus CBS 577.79 was produced in a bubble-column reactor using glucose-containing medium supplemented with 2,5-xylidine under conditions of nitrogen sufficiency. The main laccase isoenzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity by ultra-filtration, anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration that led to a purified enzyme with a specific activity of 317 IU (mg protein)-1 and a final yield of 66%. Laccase was found to be a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 69.1 kDa, pI of 3.15 and 6.9% N-glycosylation of the high mannose type. Temperature and pH optima were 55 degrees C and 3.75 (2,6-dimethoxyphenol as substrate). At 50 and 60 degrees C, the enzyme half-lives were 281 and 25 min, respectively. The P. tigrinus laccase oxidized a wide range of both naturally occurring and synthetic aromatic compounds: the highest catalytic efficiencies were for 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic) acid and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (5.99x10(6) and 3.07x10(6) M-1 s-1, respectively). Catalytic rate constants for typical N-OH redox mediators, such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (2.6 s-1), violuric acid (8.4 s-1) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-N-oxide radical (7.8 s-1), were found to be higher than those reported for other high redox potential fungal laccases.\n",
      "Polyhydroxyalkanoates in Gram-positive bacteria: insights from the genera Bacillus and Streptomyces. \n",
      "\t Gram-positive bacteria, notably Bacillus and Streptomyces, have been used extensively in industry. However, these microorganisms have not yet been exploited for the production of the biodegradable polymers, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). Although PHAs have many potential applications, the cost of production means that medical applications are currently the main area of use. Gram-negative bacteria, currently the only commercial source of PHAs, have lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which co-purify with the PHAs and cause immunogenic reactions. On the other hand, Gram- positive bacteria lack LPS, a positive feature which justifies intensive investigation into their production of PHAs. This review summarizes currently available knowledge on PHA production by Gram- positive bacteria especially Bacillus and Streptomyces. We hope that this will form the basis of further research into developing either or both as a source of PHAs for medical applications.\n",
      "APHO1 from the yeast Arxula adeninivorans encodes an acid phosphatase of broad substrate specificity. \n",
      "\t The extracellular acid phosphatase-encoding Arxula adeninivorans APHO1 gene was isolated using degenerated specific oligonucleotide primers in a PCR screening approach. The gene harbours an ORF of 1449 bp encoding a protein of 483 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 52.4 kDa. The sequence includes an N-terminal secretion sequence of 17 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibits 54% identity to phytases from Aspergillus awamori, Asp. niger and Asp. ficuum and a more distant relationship to phytases of the yeasts Candida albicans and Debaryomyces hansenii (36-39% identity). The sequence contains the phosphohistidine signature and the conserved active site sequence of acid phosphatases. APHO1 expression is induced under conditions of phosphate limitation. Enzyme isolates from wild and recombinant strains with the APHO1 gene expressed under control of the strong A. adeninivorans-derived TEF1 promoter were characterized. For both proteins, a molecular mass of approx. 350 kDa, corresponding to a hexameric structure, a pH optimum of pH 4.8 and a temperature optimum of 60 degrees C were determined. The preferred substrates include p-nitrophenyl-phosphate, pyridoxal-5-phosphate, 3-indoxyl-phosphate, 1-naphthylphosphate, ADP, glucose-6-phosphate, sodium-pyrophosphate, and phytic acid. Thus the enzyme is a secretory acid phosphatase with phytase activity and not a phytase as suggested by strong homology to such enzymes.\n",

      "\t During the course of screening for industrially important microorganisms, an alkali-tolerant and thermotolerant actinomycete, strain DAS 131T, was isolated from a soil sample collected from the Gulbarga region, Karnataka province, India. The strain was characterized by a polyphasic approach that showed that it belonged to the genus Streptomyces. Growth was observed over a wide pH range (pH 6-12) and at 45 degrees C. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain DAS 131T was deposited in the GenBank database under the accession number DQ317411. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain DAS 131T was most closely related to Streptomyces venezuelae ISP 5230T (AY999739) with a sequence similarity of 99.5% (8 nucleotide differences out of 1,477). Despite this very high sequence similarity, strain DAS 131T was phenetically distinct from S. venezuelae. The DNA relatedness between these strains was 54%, indicating that strain DAS 131T is a distinct genomic species. On the basis of phenetic and genetic analyses, strain DAS 131T is classified as a new species in the genus Streptomyces, for which we propose the name Streptomyces gulbargensis sp. nov.\n",
      "Protein expression in Escherichia coli S17-1 biofilms: impact of indole. \n",
      "\t Bacteria undergo significant changes during adherence to surfaces and biofilm development. Cell-to-cell signalling molecules are known to be involved in these phenotypic adaptations to the sessile mode of life. We demonstrated previously that indole can act as an extracellular signal to regulate biofilm formation in E. coli. To identify proteins over- or under-expressed in response to E. coli biofilm formation and indole signalling, we compared the proteomes of the E. coli S17-1 wild-type and 3714 (S17-1 tnaA::Tn5) tryptophanase-negative mutant cells (which don't produce indole) grown as suspensions or biofilms in the presence or absence of exogenous indole. From computer-assisted image analysis, 407 spots were discriminated on two-dimensional electropherograms. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the electropherograms did not discriminate between the proteomes of the wild-type and mutant cells grown as suspensions indicating that indole has a limited impact onto protein expression of planktonic cells. The first principal component extracted by PCA, after standardization of the observations, opposed planktonic and biofilm cells confirming the existence of changes in protein expression during E. coli biofilm formation. Among proteins over- or under-expressed by both sessile wild-type and mutant cells, we identified metabolic enzymes, transporters, proteins involved in the translation and transcription machinery, stress response and regulation, and signalling proteins. The wild-type and mutant strains grown as biofilms in the presence of indole were discriminated by the second component. The role of some proteins whose expression was altered in biofilm bacteria compared to suspended counterparts is discussed.\n",
      "Viability and physiological state transitions of Rhizopus oligosporus sporangiospores in tempe starter culture. \n",
      "\t The viability and various physiological characteristics of individual sporangiospores of Rhizopus oligosporus in tempe starter cultures that had been stored for 8, 10, 16 and 30 months were examined by flow cytometry in combination with fluorescent dyes. Besides live, dead, and dormant spores we distinguished a category of sublethally damaged spores. Results indicated that the shelf-life of tempe starters was not limited by the death of spores, but by sublethal damage to spores as well as by dormancy which can be overcome by resuscitation, respiratory activation. During storage, the number of dormant and sublethally damaged spores increased: the longer the starter cultures were stored, the less dormant spores could still be activated. In contrast, the transition from sublethally damaged (spores that are not able to transform cFDA and emit green fluorescence except by activation treatment) to activated spores did not decrease with longer storage. However, after very long (30 months) storage, sublethally damaged spores could still be activated but could not germinate anymore. The shelf-life of spores in tempe starter is related to the physiological state of spores being sublethally damaged; a mechanism of physiological state transitions of R. oligosporus sporangiospores is proposed.\n",
      "Bacterial endosymbioses in Solemya (Mollusca: Bivalvia)--model systems for studies of symbiont-host adaptation. \n",
      "\t Endosymbioses between chemosynthetic bacteria and marine invertebrates are remarkable biological adaptations to life in sulfide-rich environments. In these mutualistic associations, sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria living directly within host cells both aid in the detoxification of toxic sulfide and fix carbon to support the metabolic needs of the host. Though best described for deep-sea vents and cold seeps, these symbioses are ubiquitous in shallow-water reducing environments. Indeed, considerable insight into sulfur-oxidizing endosymbioses in general comes from detailed studies of shallow-water protobranch clams in the genus Solemya. This review highlights the impressive body of work characterizing bacterial symbiosis in Solemya species, all of which are presumed to harbor endosymbionts. In particular, studies of the coastal Atlantic species Solemya velum and its larger Pacific congener Solemya reidi are the foundation for our understanding of the metabolism and physiology of marine bivalve symbioses, which are now known to occur in five families. Solemya velum, in particular, is an excellent model organism for symbiosis research. This clam can be collected easily from coastal eelgrass beds and maintained in laboratory aquaria for extended periods. In addition, the genome of the S. velum symbiont is currently being sequenced. The integration of genomic data with additional experimental analyses will help reveal the molecular basis of the symbiont-host interaction in Solemya, thereby complementing the wide array of research programs aimed at better understanding the diverse relationships between bacterial and eukaryotic cells.\n",
      "Biological control of the size and reactivity of catalytic Pd(0) produced by Shewanella oneidensis. \n",
      "\t The interaction between Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and the soluble metal Pd(II) during the reductive precipitation of Pd(0) determined the size and properties of the precipitated Pd(0) nanoparticles. Assessment of cell viability indicated that the bioreduction of Pd(II) was a detoxification mechanism depending on the Pd(II) concentration and on the presence and properties of the electron donor. The addition of H(2) in the headspace allowed S. oneidensis to resist the toxic effects of Pd(II). Interestingly, 25 mM formate was a less effective electron donor for bioreductive detoxification of Pd(II), since there was a 2 log reduction of culturable cells and a 20% decrease of viable cells within 60 min, followed by a slow recovery. When the ratio of Pd:cell dry weight (CDW) was below 5:2 at a concentration of 50 mg l(-1) Pd(II), most of the cells remained viable. These viable cells precipitated Pd(0) crystals over a relatively larger bacterial surface area and had a particle area that was up to 100 times smaller when compared to Pd(0) crystals formed on non-viable biomass (Pd:CDW ratio of 5:2). The relatively large and densely covering Pd(0) crystals on non-viable biomass exhibited high catalytic reactivity towards hydrophobic molecules such as polychlorinated biphenyls, while the smaller and more dispersed nanocrystals on a viable bacterial carrier exhibited high catalytic reactivity towards the reductive degradation of the anionic pollutant perchlorate.\n",

      "Alcoholic fermentation of carbon sources in biomass hydrolysates by Saccharomyces cerevisiae: current status. \n",
      "\t Fuel ethanol production from plant biomass hydrolysates by Saccharomyces cerevisiae is of great economic and environmental significance. This paper reviews the current status with respect to alcoholic fermentation of the main plant biomass-derived monosaccharides by this yeast. Wild-type S. cerevisiae strains readily ferment glucose, mannose and fructose via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway of glycolysis, while galactose is fermented via the Leloir pathway. Construction of yeast strains that efficiently convert other potentially fermentable substrates in plant biomass hydrolysates into ethanol is a major challenge in metabolic engineering. The most abundant of these compounds is xylose. Recent metabolic and evolutionary engineering studies on S. cerevisiae strains that express a fungal xylose isomerase have enabled the rapid and efficient anaerobic fermentation of this pentose. L: -Arabinose fermentation, based on the expression of a prokaryotic pathway in S. cerevisiae, has also been established, but needs further optimization before it can be considered for industrial implementation. In addition to these already investigated strategies, possible approaches for metabolic engineering of galacturonic acid and rhamnose fermentation by S. cerevisiae are discussed. An emerging and major challenge is to achieve the rapid transition from proof-of-principle experiments under 'academic' conditions (synthetic media, single substrates or simple substrate mixtures, absence of toxic inhibitors) towards efficient conversion of complex industrial substrate mixtures that contain synergistically acting inhibitors.\n",
      "Interpretation of mtDNA RFLP variability among Aspergillus tubingensis isolates. \n",
      "\t Aspergillus tubingensis isolates collected from distant geographic areas were earlier classified into six groups on the basis of the mtDNA RFLP variability they exhibited (mtDNA types 2a-2f). In the present work, we investigated the reason for the intraspecific mtDNA variability and we describe here how this fungus, with a relatively small mitochondrial genome, can display intraspecific polymorphism due to intron acquisition and also sporadic point mutations affecting the recognition motifs of the restriction enzymes employed in the RFLP analysis. Three different LAGLI-DADG type group I introns were identified in the cox1 gene amongst the six mtDNA RFLP types. MtDNAs of types 2b and 2d contain all of the three introns, mtDNA of type 2f carries only one, and the other mtDNA types contain two introns each. Comparative analysis showed that the first and second introns of mtDNAs of types 2b and 2d are well distributed among fungi, indicating their active horizontal transfer capacity. The third intron occurs rarely among fungi and is restricted to a limited number of fungal species, namely to A. tubingensis and the yeast Candida stellata. It is interesting that this intron is present in a small mitochondrial genome such as that of A. tubingensis and, considering its rarity, its presence amongst black Aspergillus isolates is recommended to be considered as a tool to establish taxonomical unit(s) or to track down evolutionary divergence of closely related taxonomical units.\n",

      "\t Interest in species of the genus Penicillium is related to their ability to produce the mycotoxin patulin and to cause spoilage of fruit products worldwide. The sequence of the isoepoxydon dehydrogenase (idh) gene, a gene in the patulin biosynthetic pathway, was determined for 28 strains representing 12 different Penicillium species known to produce the mycotoxin patulin. Isolates of Penicillium carneum, Penicillium clavigerum, Penicillium concentricum, Penicillium coprobium, Penicillium dipodomyicola, Penicillium expansum, Penicillium gladioli, Penicillium glandicola, Penicillium griseofulvum, Penicillium paneum, Penicillium sclerotigenum and Penicillium vulpinum were compared. Primer pairs for DNA amplification and sequencing were designed from the P. griseofulvum idh gene (GenBank AF006680). The two introns present were removed from the nucleotide sequences, which were translated to produce the IDH sequences of the 12 species for comparison. Phylogenetic relationships among the species were determined from rDNA (ITS1, 5.8 S, ITS2 and partial sequence of 28S rDNA) and from the idh nucleotide sequences minus the two introns. Maximum parsimony analysis showed trees based on rDNA and idh sequences to be congruent. It is anticipated that the genetic information obtained in the present study will aid in the design of probes, specific for patulin biosynthetic pathway genes, to identify the presence of these mycotoxigenic fungi.\n",

      "\t A slow growing bacterial population able to utilize hexamethylelenetetramine (urotropine) as sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy was isolated from soil. From this crude enrichment culture two bacteria were isolated and identified as Brevundimonas diminuta and a Phyllobacterium sp. by sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA. These bacteria also grew on urotropine but at a lower rate than the enrichment culture. Addition of glucose to the latter resulted in growth of some yeasts that overgrew the bacteria. Assimilation of urotropine as sole nitrogen source is very common among yeasts, 46 out of 60 species tested showed this characteristic.\n",
      "Role of eukaryotic microbiota in soil survival and catabolic performance of the 2,4-D herbicide degrading bacteria Cupriavidus necator JMP134. \n",
      "\t Cupriavidus necator (formerly Ralstonia eutropha) JMP134, harbouring the catabolic plasmid pJP4, is the best-studied 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) herbicide degrading bacterium. A study of the survival and catabolic performance of strain JMP134 in agricultural soil microcosms exposed to high levels of 2,4-D was carried out. When C. necator JMP134 was introduced into soil microcosms, the rate of 2,4-D removal increased only slightly. This correlated with the poor survival of the strain, as judged by 16S rRNA gene terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles, and the semi-quantitative detection of the pJP4-borne tfdA gene sequence, encoding the first step in 2,4-D degradation. After 3 days of incubation in irradiated soil microcosms, the survival of strain JMP134 dramatically improved and the herbicide was completely removed. The introduction of strain JMP134 into native soil microcosms did not produce detectable changes in the structure of the bacterial community, as judged by 16S rRNA gene T-RFLP profiles, but provoked a transient increase of signals putatively corresponding to protozoa, as indicated by 18S rRNA gene T-RFLP profiling. Accordingly, a ciliate able to feed on C. necator JMP134 could be isolated after soil enrichment. In native soil microcosms, C. necator JMP134 survived better than Escherichia coli DH5alpha (pJP4) and similarly to Pseudomonas putida KT2442 (pJP4), indicating that species specific factors control the survival of strains harbouring pJP4. The addition of cycloheximide to soil microcosms strongly improved survival of these three strains, indicating that the eukaryotic microbiota has a strong negative effect in bioaugmentation with catabolic bacteria.\n",
      "Microbial transport: adaptations to natural environments. \n",
      "\t The cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria is the matrix for metabolic energy transducing processes such as proton motive force generation and solute transport. Passive permeation of protons across the cytoplasmic membrane is a crucial determinant in the proton motive generating capacity of the organisms. Adaptations of the membrane composition are needed to restrict the proton permeation rates especially at higher temperatures. Thermophilic bacteria cannot sufficiently restrict this proton permeation at their growth temperature and have to rely on the much lower permeation of Na + to generate a sodium motive force for driving metabolic energy-dependent membrane processes. Specific transport systems mediate passage across the membrane at physiological rates of all compounds needed for growth and metabolism and of all end products of metabolism. Some of transport systems, the secondary transporters, transduce one form of electrochemical energy into another form. These transporters can play crucial roles in the generation of metabolic energy. This is especially so in anaerobes such as Lactic Acid Bacteria which live under energy-limited conditions. Several transport systems are specifically aimed at the generation of metabolic energy during periods of energy-limitation. In their natural environment bacteria are also often exposed to cytotoxic compounds, including antibiotics. Many bacteria can respond to this live-threatening condition by overexpressing powerful drug-extruding multidrug resistance systems.\n",

      "\t Marine sponges are abundant and ecologically important components of coral reefs and have been shown to harbour exceptionally high microbial densities, which can differ substantially among sponge species. However, this dichotomy between high and low microbial abundance (HMA, LMA) sponges is still not fully understood, particularly as concerns the archaeal community. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing (using 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene) how the archaeal community varies among known LMA (Stylissa carteri, and Stylissa massa), known HMA (Hyrtios erectus and Xestospongia testudinaria) and unknown HMA/LMA status sponge species (Ectyoplasia coccinea, Paratetilla bacca and Petrosia aff. spheroida) collected in a remote location in which very few sponge microbial composition studies have been previously performed (Mayotte, Comores archipelago, France) and comparing the results with those reported in four other geographical areas. Based on archaeal community composition, the known LMA sponges formed a distinct cluster together with Paratetilla bacca, Ectyoplasia coccinea and seawater while the known HMA sponge X. testudinaria formed a cluster with Petrosia aff. spheroida. The known HMA sponge H. erectus, in turn, had an intermediate archaeal community between HMA sponges and sediment samples. In addition to the above, we also showed significant compositional congruence between archaeal and bacterial communities sampled from the same sponge individuals. HMA sponges were mainly dominated by members assigned to the genus Nitrosopumilus while LMA sponges were mainly dominated by members assigned to the genus Cenarchaeum. In general, there was no clear difference in richness between HMA and LMA sponges. Evenness, however, was higher in HMA than LMA sponges. Whilst the present study corroborates some of the traits commonly associated with the HMA-LMA dichotomy (higher evenness in Mayotte HMA sponges), this was not consistent across geographical areas showing that more research is needed to fully understand the HMA/LMA dichotomy as concerns Archaea.\n",

For accurate identification at the species level, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) in the hsp65 and partial 16S rRNA genes and full gene sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene were used. Twenty-seven Nocardia spp. were isolated and analysis of phenotypic tests results showed Nocardia asteroides complex, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, Nocardia nova, and Nocardia spp. New RFLP patterns of Nocardia strains with hsp65 and partial 16S rRNA genes were obtained. Full gene sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene identified Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, N. otitidiscaviarum, Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia transvalensis, and N. nova. Nocardia infections are rarely reported and this genus is the cause of various illnesses. Accurate identification of Nocardia spp. is important for epidemiology studies and treatment. It should also be noted that some species may have similar RFLP patterns; therefore, full gene sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is necessary for confirmation. \n",

Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that this strain formed a distinct phyletic line within the radiation of the genus Amycolatopsis. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity indicated that strain KLBMP 1221(T) was most closely related to Amycolatopsis eurytherma NT202(T) (98.9%), Amycolatopsis tucumanensis ABO(T) (98.8%), Amycolatopsis thermoflava N1165(T) (98.6%) and Amycolatopsis methanolica IMSNU 20055(T) (98.5%).

The fingerprinting disclosed three distinct groups at Helgoland Roads, representing V. parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus and one group in between. The species V. parahaemolyticus occurred mainly in summer months. None of the strains carried the virulence-associated genes tdh or trh. We further analyzed the influence of nutrients, secchi depth, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton on the abundance of Vibrio spp. and the population structure of V. parahaemolyticus. Spearman Rank analysis revealed that particularly temperature correlated significantly with Vibrio spp. numbers. Based on multivariate statistical analyses we report that the V. parahaemolyticus population was structured by a complex combination of environmental parameters. To further investigate these influences is the key to understanding the dynamics of Vibrio spp. in temperate European waters, where this microbial group and especially the pathogenic species, are likely to gain in importance.\n",
      "Proteomic insights into cold adaptation of psychrotrophic and mesophilic Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans strains. \n",
      "\t Cold tolerant strains of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans play a role in metal leaching and acid mine drainage (AMD) production in northern latitude/boreal mining environments. In this study we used a proteomics and bioinformatics approach to decipher the proteome changes related to sustained growth at low temperatures to increase our understanding of cold adaptation mechanisms in A. ferrooxidans strains. Changes in protein abundance in response to low temperatures (5 and 15°C) were monitored and protein analyses of a psychrotrophic strain (D6) versus a mesophilic strain (F1) showed that both strains increased levels of 11 stress-related and metabolic proteins including survival protein SurA, trigger factor Tig, and AhpC-Tsa antioxidant proteins. However, a unique set of changes in the proteome of psychrotrophic strain D6 were observed. In particular, the importance of protein fate, membrane transport and structure for psychrotrophic growth were evident with increases in numerous chaperone and transport proteins including GroEL, SecB, ABC transporters and a capsule polysaccharide export protein. We also observed that low temperature iron oxidation coincides with a relative increase in the key iron metabolism protein rusticyanin, which was more highly expressed in strain D6 than in strain F1 at colder growth temperatures. We demonstrate that the psychrotrophic strain uses a global stress response and cold-active metabolism which permit growth of A. ferrooxidans in the extreme AMD environment in colder climates.\n",
      "Seasonal and spatial diversity of microbial communities in marine sediments of the South China Sea. \n",
      "\t This study was conducted to characterize the diversity of microbial communities in marine sediments of the South China Sea by means of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. The results revealed that the sediment samples collected in summer harboured a more diverse microbial community than that collected in winter, Deltaproteobacteria dominated 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from both seasons, followed by Gammaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, Firmicutes. Archaea phylotypes were also found. The majority of clone sequences shared greatest similarity to uncultured organisms, mainly from hydrothermal sediments and cold seep sediments. In addition, the sedimentary microbial communities in the coastal sea appears to be much more diverse than that of the open sea. A spatial pattern in the sediment samples was observed that the sediment samples collected from the coastal sea and the open sea clustered separately, a novel microbial community dominated the open sea. The data indicate that changes in environmental conditions are accompanied by significant variations in diversity of microbial communities at the South China Sea.\n",
      "Mutually exclusive distribution of the sap and eag S-layer genes and the lytB/lytA cell wall hydrolase genes in Bacillus thuringiensis. \n",
      "\t Recently, two Bacillus thuringiensis strains were reported to synthesize parasporal inclusion bodies made not of the expected crystal (Cry) proteins but rather of the surface layer proteins (SLP) Sap (encoded by sap) and EA1 (encoded by eag), respectively. Whether the presence of the sap and eag genes is restricted to these two B. thuringiensis strains or ubiquitous in B. thuringiensis is unknown. We report here the distribution of the sap and eag genes in B. thuringiensis. Strains in the Bacillus cereus group were added for comparison purposes. We show that sap and eag are either present in tandem in 35% of the B. thuringiensis strains analysed and absent in 65% of the strains. When absent, a different tandem, the lytB/lytA cell wall hydrolase genes, is present. The distribution of the sap and eag S-layer and the lytB/lytA cell wall hydrolase genes is not species-specific in B. thuringiensis, B. cereus and Bacillus weihenstephanensis. Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus mycoides harbor sap and eag but not lytB/lytA. The sap, eag and lytB/lytA genes were absent in Bacillus pseudomycoides. Clearly, the distribution of the sap and eag S-layer and the lytB/lytA cell wall hydrolase genes in B. thuringiensis and in the Bacillus cereus group is mutually exclusive. We also showed that two genes involved in cell wall metabolism, csaA and csaB, are present not only upstream of the sap and eag S-layer genes, but also upstream of the lytB/lytA tandem in strains where sap and eag are absent. Bootstrapped neighbor-joining trees were inferred from the translated amino acid sequences of sap, eag and the tandem lytB/lytA, respectively.\n",

      "Distribution and evolution of chitinase genes in Streptomyces species: involvement of gene-duplication and domain-deletion. \n",
      "\t Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) possesses nine genes for family 18 chitinases and two for family 19, showing high multiplicity. By hybridization analyses, distribution of those chitinase genes was investigated in six other Streptomyces species covering the whole phylogenetic range based on 16S rDNA sequences. All strains showed high-multiplicity of chitinase genes, like S. coelicolor A3(2). The phylogeny and gene organization of the family 18 chitinase genes cloned from Streptomyces species so far were then analyzed to investigate the gene evolution. It was concluded that Streptomyces already possessed a variety of chitinase genes prior to branching into many species, and that the ancestral genes of chiA and chiB have been generated by gene-duplication. In the course of the analyses, evidence that the chi30 and chi40 genes of S. thermoviolaceus were derived from their corresponding original chitinase genes by losing gene parts for substrate-binding domains and fibronectin type III-like domains was obtained. It was thus shown that gene-duplication and domain-deletion were implicated in generating the high diversity and multiplicity of chitinase genes in Streptomyces species.\n",
      "Design of catabolic cassettes for styrene biodegradation. \n",
      "\t A broad-host range metabolic cassette has been designed that, under the control of the Ptac promoter, expresses the sytABCD catabolic genes from Pseudomonas sp. Y2, which are responsible for the transformation of styrene into phenylacetic acid (styrene upper pathway). This novel cassette confers to phenylacetic acid-degrading bacteria the ability to grow efficiently on styrene as the sole carbon and energy source. By combining both the sty cassette and the archetypal pWW0 TOL plasmid into the well-known Pseudomonas putida F1 aromatic biodegrader, we have constructed a novel derivative strain that shows one of the largest degradative potentials so far described for aromatic hydrocarbons, because it is able to use BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) and styrene as a source of carbon and energy. Furthermore, the sty cassette was engineered within a mini-transposon and endowed with a gene containment system, based on the toxic effect of the colicin E3 RNase, to reduce its lateral spread to other hosts. This contained cassette lacks defined transcriptional regulatory signals and, thus, it becomes an alternative strategy to select recombinant strains that efficiently express the desired phenotype from housekeeping regulatory elements.\n",
      "Implication of two glutathione S-transferases in the optimal metabolism of m-toluate by Sphingomonas yanoikuyae B1. \n",
      "\t A putative glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene (bphK) was identified in the meta-cleavage operon for the degradation of m-toluate by Sphingomonas yanoikuyae B1. Disruption of bphK resulted in the loss of GST activity against 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and a much increased lag time of the mutant strain MB3 (bphK::Km) following subculture into m-toluate medium. In contrast, an increased lag time was not observed when MB3 was grown on biphenyl or m-xylene and MB3 showed normal growth on m-toluate when complemented with a subclone containing the bphK gene only. Furthermore, an additional GST activity was detected in MB3. The induction timing of this second GST activity coincided with the beginning of the exponential growth phase of MB3 on m-toluate, reached maximal activity within three hours, and then dropped sharply to the basal level. Thus, it is apparent that BphK and/or the second GST are necessary for optimal growth of B1 on m-toluate.\n",
      "Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a glycolytic enzyme present in the periplasm of Aeromonas hydrophila. \n",
      "\t This is the first report describing the glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), as a protein associated with the cell envelope of a gram-negative bacterium (Aeromonas hydrophila). Dose-dependent GAPDH activity was detected in whole bacterial cells from exponentially growing cultures, indicating that an active form of GAPDH is located outside the plasma membrane. This activity represents roughly 10-20% of total cell activity, and it is not reduced by pretreatment of the cells with trypsin. Assays with soluble GAPDH indicate that the activity measured in intact cells does not originate by rebinding to intact cells of cytosolic enzyme released following cell lysis. GAPDH activity levels detected in intact cells varied during the growth phase. The relationship between GAPDH activity and cell culture density was not linear, showing this activity as a major peak in the late-logarithmic phase (A600 = 1.1-1.3), and a decrease when cells entered the stationary phase. The late exponential growing cells showed a GAPDH activity 3 to 4-fold higher than early growing or stationary cells. No activity was detected in culture supernatants. Enzymatic and Western-immunoblotting analysis of subcellular fractions (cytosol, whole and outer membranes, and periplasm) showed that GAPDH is located in the cytosol, as expected, and also in the periplasm. These results place the periplasmic GAPDH of A. hydrophila into the family of multifunctional microbial cell wall-associated GAPDHs which retain their catalytic activity.\n",

      "\t Clinically significant aerobic sporoactinomycetes, notably agents of mycetoma, were examined for a balanced set of unit characters and the resultant data analysed using standard numerical taxonomic procedures. All save two of the one hundred and seventy three tested strains were assigned to three multimembered cluster-groups, which encompassed sixteen major (4-7 strains), ten minor (2-3 strains) and forty single membered clusters, in an analysis based on the simple matching coefficient and unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages algorithm. The three cluster-groups were equated with the genus Actinomadura (including Actinocorallia and Streptomyces somaliensis strains), and the genera Nocardiopsis and Streptomyces, and Thermobifida and Thermomonospora, respectively. In a corresponding principal co-ordinates analysis four multimembered groups corresponding to the genera Actinomadura, Nocardiopsis, Streptomyces, and Thermobifida and Thermomonospora were recognised. The causal agents of actinomycetoma were not only assigned to established taxa, notably, to Actinomadura latina, Actinomadura madurae, Actinomadura pelletieri and Streptomyces somaliensis, but also to additional centres of taxonomic variation which were equated with the rank of species. Most of the streptomycetes isolated from clinical material were assigned to clusters equated with the species Streptomyces albus and Streptomyces anulatus. The numerical taxonomic data were used to generate a frequency matrix designed to facilitate the identification of clinically significant Actinomadura, Nocardiopsis and Streptomyces strains to the species level; rapid enzyme tests accounted for eleven out of the twenty-one diagnostic tests.\n",

      "\t Di- and tricarboxylates found as intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle can be utilized by many bacteria and serve as carbon and energy source under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. A prerequisite for metabolism is that the carboxylates are transported into the cells across the cytoplasmic membrane. Bacillus subtilis is able to metabolize many di- and tricarboxylates and in this overview the available data on all known and putative di- and tricarboxylate transporters in B. subtilis is summarized. The B. subtilis transporters, that are of the secondary type, are discussed in the context of the protein families to which they belong. Available data on biochemical characterization, regulation of gene expression and the physiological function is summarized. It is concluded that in B. subtilis multiple transporters are present for tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates.\n",

      "\t Mycobacterium vaccae is of major pharmaceutical interest as an immunotherapeutic agent. Although M. vaccae 15483 ATCC(T) strain displays smooth and rough colonial morphologies on solid culture media, it is not known in which conditions M. vaccae switches from one colonial morphotype to the other or whether there are biological differences, especially immunological, between them. We have found that the change from a smooth to rough stable variant occurs spontaneously at 30 degrees C. The analysis of the composition of the cell wall in both variants showed that the smooth morphotype presents an extracellular material that has never previously been described and was identified as a long-chain saturated polyester that, interestingly, is not produced by the rough morphotype. Our results also indicate that this compound could be implicated in the spreading ability of smooth colonies. Proliferation, IFN-gamma and IL-12(p40) production by splenocyte cultures was significantly higher in mice immunised with the rough variant compared with those immunised with the smooth one. This latter finding suggests that the different colonial morphology of M. vaccae may affect the immunomodulatory effects induced from M. vaccae preparations.\n",

      "\t Pieces of rotten wood collected in the forest were screened for the presence of yeasts. In spring time 3 tree species were sampled, followed by 9 species in summer. Yeast strains were identified by traditional methods. Identifications were confirmed by sequencing of ribosomal DNA in case of doubt. In total 14 yeast species of ascomycetous affiliation and 6 anamorphic basidiomycetous yeasts were isolated and identified. Most species were represented by only one strain, but Candida bertae by two and Trichosporon porosum by six strains, all from different wood samples. Three strains represented novel species, one of which is described as Cryptococcus fagi Middelhoven et Scorzetti. The type strain is CBS 9964 (JCM 13614). All strains were tested for growth on several polysaccharides as sole carbon source. Only some of these polymers supported growth of ascomycetous yeasts. Basidiomycetous yeasts assimilated soluble starch, pullulan, dextran, xylan, polygalacturonate, galactomannan and tannic acid or at least some of these. Cryptococcus podzolicus and T. porosum were the most active in this respect. None of the isolated strains grew on carboxymethyl cellulose, colloidal chitin, arabinogalactan and gum xanthan. Phenolic compounds were assimilated by several strains, belonging to the Trichosporonales and the Microbotryum and Stephanoascus/Blastobotrys clades, but not by members of the Tremellales (Cryptococcus musci excepted) and the Debaryomyces/Lodderomyces clade.

      "\t Bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere of beach morning glory (Calystegia soldanella) and wild rye (Elymus mollis), two of the major plant species inhabiting the coastal sane dune in Tae-An, Korea, was studied by the analysis of community 16S rRNA gene clones. The amplified rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) of the clones using HaeIII exhibited significant differences in the community composition between the two plant species as well as regional differences, but also identified a specific ARDRA pattern that was most common among the clones regardless of plant species. Subsequent sequence analysis indicated that the pattern was that of Lysobacter spp., which is a member of the family Xanthomonadaceae, class Gamma proteobacteria. The Lysobacter clones comprised 50.6% of the clones derived from C. soldanella and 62.5% of those from E. mollis. Other minor patterns included those of Pseudomonas spp., species of Rhizobium, Chryseobacterium spp. and Pantoea spp. among C. soldanella clones, and Pseudomonas sp. and Aeromonas hydrophila among E. mollis clones. It is not yet clear what kind of roles Lysobacter plays in association with sand dune plants, but its universal presence in the rhizosphere, together with the potential of this taxon for antagonistic activity against plant pathogens, suggests that Lysobacter might form a symbiotic relationship with its host plants.\n",

So far, there is no information regarding the yeast communities that occur in their nests. Here, we evaluated the diversity, composition, and structure of yeast communities in both fungus gardens (FG) and external refuse dump (RD) of this ant species (Palmas, Tocantins, northern Brazil). A total of 720 yeasts were isolated, comprising 52 species distributed in 29 genera. The RDs have significantly richer and more diverse yeast communities than the fungus gardens, regardless of the season and the level of preservation in the area. The isolates produced a wide range of carbon polymer-degrading enzymes and were able to assimilate carbon-sources present in plant materials. We observed a different proportion of enzyme-producers and carbon-assimilation found in external refuse dump and fungus gardens from preserved and disturbed areas, suggesting that this interaction may vary depending on the environmental conditions. A. balzani nests in the savanna biome are a hotspot of yeast species with ecological, clinical, and biotechnological implications.\n",

The value for O2 and those for the N-oxides are, respectively, somewhat larger and smaller than corresponding values for Paracoccus denitrificans. None of the three permeant ions employed with the Alcaligenes sp. (valinomycin-K+, thiocyanate and triphenylmethylphosphonium) was ideal for all purposes. Thiocyanate provided highest ratios for O2 but abolished the oxidant pulse response for nitrate and N2O. Valinomycin was slow to penetrate to the cytoplasmic membrane and relatively high concentrations were required for optimal performance. Triphenylmethylphosphonium enhanced passive proton permeability and diminished proton translocation at concentrations required to realize the maximal oxidant pulse response.\n",

      "\t The activity and stability of several enzymes from the facultative thermophile Bacillus flavothermus, grown within the mesophilic and thermophilic region at 34 degrees C, 43 degrees C, 52 degrees C and 70 degrees C, have been examined. While the temperature optima and maxima of all enzymes tested were found to remain unchanged at all growth temperatures, it was demonstrated that the heat stability of the proteins increased with ten perature, however, not uniformly for all enzymes. One exception was acetate kinase and the intrinsic stability of pyruvate kinase was found to increase only slightly. With all other proteins tested (alanine dehydrogenase, isocitric dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutamate-oxalacetate and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase and myokinase) the intrinsic stability was found to increase to about 55 degrees C, but stayed unaltered at higher growth temperatures. Except for acetate kinase and myokinase, the enzymes could be stabilized by their respective substrates and the heat stability of the ES-complexes was found also to depend on the growth temperature of the cells. These data lead to the conclusion that the enzymes undergo a transition from heat-labile to thermostable within the growth temperature range between 44 degrees C and 51 degrees C while the thermal characteristics are not changed below and beyond this crucial region.\n",

      "\t Plasmid biology has become an important area of investigation in dairy starter cultures since it now appears that some properties, vital for successful milk fermentations, are coded by genes located on plasmid DNA. Some of these metabolic properties observed in lactic streptococci have been clearly established as being plasmid-mediated. Examples would be lactose utilization and in Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis the ability to produce a bacteriocin-like substance. Phenotypic and physical evidence for plasmid linkage has been obtained for other traits such as citrate, sucrose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose utilization, proteinase activity, modification/restriction systems, as well as for nisin production. Further genetic evidence is now needed to confirm plasmid association to these properties. For some characteristics the association with plasmids is highly speculative and is solely based on the phenotypic loss of a metabolic property. In this category would be sensitivity to agglutinins, sensitivity to the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide inhibitory system, arginine hydrolysis, and slime production. Other properties which appear plasmid-mediated in lactic streptococci and which will be discussed include inorganic ion resistance, drug resistance, and diplococcin production.\n",

Mating took place freely with α strains of M. bowlesiae, M. dekortorum, and M. similis, but two-spored asci, indicative of a fertile meiotic progeny, were formed abundantly only with certain strains of M. dekortorum. Accordingly, we examined mating success among every phylotype in the clade and constructed a phylogeny based on a concatenation of 100 of the largest orthologous genes annotated in draft genomes. The analyses confirmed membership of the Amazonian isolate in M. dekortorum, but also indicated that the species should be subdivided into two. As a result, we retain three original members of M. dekortorum in the species, together with the new isolate, and reassign six isolates recovered from Mesoamerican lacustrine habitats to Metschnikowia lacustris sp. nov.

The Mediterranei clade species showed values between 76 and 95% for ANIb, 84 and 95% for ANIm. The core genome consisted of 2057 gene families and the pan-genome of 13,094 gene families. Based on the genomic analyses performed, the Mediterranei clade can be divided in two clusters, one with the strains of V. maritimus, V. variabilis and two potential new species, and the other cluster with the strains of V. mediterranei, V. thalassae, and V. barjaei.\n",

      "\t Incorporation of organic compounds into cell protein by the obligate chemolithotrophs Nitrosomonas spec., Nitrosococcus oceanus, Nitrosococcus mobilis, Nitrosovibrio tenuis, Nitrosolobus spec., and Nitrosospira spec. was studied. In the presence of ammonia as energy source organic substrates were supplied. Distribution of 14C into cell amino acids arising from 14C-labelled glucose, Na-pyruvate, and Na-acetate was investigated. While carbon from glucose was distributed unrestricted, carbon from pyruvate preferably entered into the amino acids of the pyruvate and glutamate family and from acetate mainly into leucine and the glutamate family. Among the strains examined, slight differences were observed, but all should be included under group A of the scheme of Smith and Hoare (1977).\n",
      "Bacteriological testing of a modified laminar flow microbiological safety cabinet. \n",
      "\t A modified microbiological safety cabinet which can be used as a class II and a class III safety cabinet has been bacteriologically tested. This cabinet makes use of a high-speed down-flow air curtain in the front opening to minimize the amount of air escaping over the arms of the operator. By using artificial aerosols and a dummy or a test person placing his arms into the working opening of the cabinet, a transfer from the inside to the environment was detected only when the highest concentration of the test aerosol was used. Since the number of bacteria detected was very low, this is considered to be acceptable. When the cabinet was used as a class III type, with a glove panel mounted in the front opening, leakage from the environment occurred. This could be completely prevented by fixing tape over the hinge of the front panel. The conclusion is drawn that this type of biohazard hood can be safely used as a class II and a class III microbiological safety cabinet, provided the construction of the hinge of the front panel will be adapted to prevent transfer from the environment to the working area.\n",

      "\t A Gram-positive, nonmotile, moderately halophilic, alkali and thermotolerant strain designated DAS 165(T), was isolated from a dry land soil sample from the Gulbarga region, Karnataka province, India. The isolate produced yellow substrate mycelia and gray aerial mycelia on most tested media. Strain DAS 165(T) showed growth in the presence of 5 to 7% NaCl and at 45 degrees C. The DNA G + C content was 69.7%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis together with these characteristics consistently assigned strain DAS 165(T) to the genus Streptomyces. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain DAS 165(T) was most closely related to S. tendae ATCC 19812(T) (D 63873) with a sequence similarity of 99.6% (three nucleotide differences out of 1,517). Strain DAS 165(T) formed a distinct clade based on analysis of the almost complete sequence and 120-nucleotide variable gamma region of the 16S rRNA gene. Despite the high sequence similarity, strain DAS 165(T) was phenotypically different from S. tendae ATCC 19812(T). DNA-DNA hybridization between these strains was 47% showing that strain DAS 165(T) is a distinct genomic species. Phenetic and genetic results support the classification of strain DAS 165(T) as a new species, for which the name S. tritolerans is proposed, with strain DAS 165(T) as the type strain (=DSM 41899(T )= CCTCCAA 206013(T)).\n",
      "Gene arrangements characteristic of the phylum Actinobacteria. \n",
      "\t The availability of genomic sequence data allows new challenges to various biological problems. One of such attempts is the extraction of phylogenetic information from gene order data of genomes. Phylogenetic inferences are most commonly carried out on the basis of 16S rRNA trees, which sometimes produce unresolved or unreliable branching orders. One example for such a low resolution is recognized in the branching pattern among the phylum Actinobacteria. Here, gene arrangements characteristic of the Actinobacteria were identified, based on which Symbiobacterium thermophilum is phylogenetically placed outside that phylum, this being in contrast to 16S rRNA trees and to the current taxonomy in GenBank. Three transposition suggestive arrangements were found which support a notion that Rubrobacter xylanophilus is the earliest diverging species among the completely sequenced Actinobacteria. The gene arrangements identified here serve as a complement to previously reported indels and proteins characteristic of this phylum.\n",

      "\t To determine the dominant microorganisms involved in kimchi fermentation and to examine their effect on kimchi fermentation, we randomly isolated and characterized 120 lactic acid bacteria from kimchi during a 5-day fermentation at 15 degrees C. Leuconostoc citreum was dominant during the early and mid-phases of kimchi fermentation whereas Lactobacillus sake/Lactobacillus curvatus or Lactobacillus brevis were found during later stages. Eighty-two out of 120 isolates (68%) were identified as Leuconostoc citreum by means of a polyphasic method, including 16S rDNA sequencing and DNA/DNA hybridization. A few Weissella confusa-like strains were also isolated during the mid-phase of the fermentation. Strain IH22, one of the Leuconostoc citreum isolates from kimchi, was used as an additive to evaluate growth and acid production in kimchi fermentation. This strain was consistently over 95% of the population in IH22-treated kimchi over a 5-day fermentation, while heterogeneous lactic acid bacteria were observed in the control kimchi. The pH in IH22-treated kimchi dropped rapidly but was stably maintained for 5 days, compared to its slow and prolonged decrease in the control kimchi. These results indicate that Leuconostoc citreum IH22 dominates over and retards the growth of other lactic acid bacteria in kimchi, suggesting it can be used as a bacterial starter culture to maintain the quality of kimchi for prolonged periods.\n",
      "Nature and mode of action of NAD and ATP dephosphorylating enzyme from Aspergillus terreus DSM 826. \n",
      "\t NAD and ATP were dephosphorylated by Aspergillus terreus extracts optimally at pH 8 and 40 degrees C. The data obtained indicate that one phosphohydrolase was involved in the cleavage of all the phosphate linkages of these two energy-carrying molecules, and also indicate that this enzyme can be classified as a non-specific alkaline phosphatase. This is based on the following criteria: during fractionation of the enzymes of the extracts, using Sephadex G-200 column chromatography, the recorded elution diagram showed only one phosphohydrolase activity peak and this peak was the same with NAD, ATP, inorganic pyrophosphate and phenyl phosphate as substrates; the activity profiles with these four substrates were similar; and these four substrates were hydrolyzed at almost constant relative rates. Moreover, the activities of the pooled fractions with these different substrates responded similarly on changing some experimental conditions, such as addition of fluoride to the reaction mixtures or exposing the enzyme preparation to temperatures above 40 degrees C. Chromatographic detection of the intermediates and the products formed during the progression of NAD and ATP dephosphorylation by the most purified fraction of this enzyme was found to be consistent with the following mode of its action:\n",

      "\t Escherichia coli JM109 strains expressing either toluene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida F1 or biphenyl dioxygenase from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 were examined for their ability to catalyze flavones. Biphenyl dioxygenase produced metabolites from flavone and 5,7-dihydroxyflavone which were not found in the control experiments. The absorption maxima of UV-visible spectra for the metabolites from flavone and 5,7-dihydroxyflavone were found at 337 and 348 nm respectively by using a photodiode array detector in the HPLC. Liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) showed molecular weights 256 and 288 for the metabolites, respectively. The metabolite of flavone, which was isolated and purified from the bacterial culture, was further subjected to analysis by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Based on the LC/MS and NMR results, biphenyl dioxygenase inserted oxygen at C2' and C3' on the B-ring of flavone, resulting in the formation of flavone cis-2', 3'-dihydrodiol (2-[3,4-dihydroxy-1.5-cyclohexadienyl]-4H-chromen-4-one). Since this product is not found in Chemical Abstracts, this compound is considered a novel one. In addition, biotransformation of flavones by biphenyl dioxygenase suggested a potential role of bacterial dioxygenase to synthesize novel compounds from plant secondary metabolites.\n",
      "Distribution of virulence genes in clinical and environmental isolates of Aeromonas spp. \n",
      "\t The distribution and phenotypic activity of the genes encoding for serine protease, glycerophospholipid-cholesterol acyltransferase, lipases, aerolysin/hemolysin and DNases were investigated in 234 isolates identified by 16S rDNA-RFLP representing all the species of Aeromonas. The former three genes were found to be highly conserved among the genus. Aerolysin/hemolysin and DNase genes and beta-hemolytic activity were significantly more frequent in clinical than in environmental isolates. Aerolysin/hemolysin and serine protease genes were present in all beta-hemolytic strains supporting serine protease as possibly important for the activation of the former gene. The high prevalence of virulence factors in clinical isolates indicates that they may play a role in the mechanisms of pathogenesis of these microorganisms.\n",

      "\t Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous (formely Phaffia rhodozyma) is a basidiomycetous yeast-like fungus that produces carotenoids useful for the food industry. Recently, its sexual cycle was reported but little is known about its genetic constitution. To inquire into the ploidy state of X. dendrorhous, biased mutant spectrum, genetic complementation and mitotic recombination analysis were used. A wild-type strain was subjected to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine mutagenic treatment. Auxotrophic and carotene mutants were forced to revert to the wild-type phenotype. Pigment producing and prototroph revertants behaved as diploid except for adenine less mutants. These results are in agreement with the limited spectrum of auxotrophs obtained in this strain for the ADE1 locus. To analyze the genetic characteristic of the adenine genetic marker of X. dendrorhous, protoplast fusion experiments with several adenine less mutants were performed. The experiments presented in this work suggest that the ATCC 2430 (UDC 67-385) strain of X. dendrorhous is diploid and a heterozygous constitution is proposed for the ADE1 locus.\n",

      "\t Fungal laccases have been extensively exploited for industrial purposes and there is a wealth of information available regarding their reaction mechanism, biological role and several molecular aspects, including cloning, heterologous expression and transcriptional analyses. Here we present the reconstruction of the fungal laccase loci evolution inferred from the comparative analysis of 48 different sequences. The topology of the phylogenetic trees indicate that a single monophyletic branch exists for fungal laccases and that laccase isozyme genes may have evolved independently, possibly through duplication-divergence events. Laccases are copper-containing enzymes generally identified by the utilization of substituted p-diphenol substrates. Interestingly, our approach permitted the assignment of two copper-containing oxidases, preliminarily catalogued as laccases, to a different evolutionary group, distantly related to the main branch of bona fide laccases.\n",

Volatiles produced were sampled by means of headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and the compounds were analysed and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The VOCs produced were found to be alcohols (amyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol), aldehydes (2-methyl-2-hexenal and 2-isopropyl-5-methyl-2-hexenal) and esters (ethyl isobutyrate, isobutyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, 2-methylbutyl acetate, ethyl isovalerate, isoamyl propionate and phenylmethyl acetate). Differences in VOC profiles were used to cluster the yeast strains into 25 VOC phenotypes. The different frequency of VOC phenotypes in three specific habitats was correlated to the divergent environmental conditions, possibly affecting the selection of specific yeasts. From a biotechnological viewpoint, this study reveals the potentiality of ascomycetous yeasts isolated from tropical environments as a promising source of VOCs relevant in food and fragrance industry.\n",

      "\t Fifteen aquatic environments (lakes, lagoons and rivers) of glacial origin in the northern Andean Patagonia (Argentina) were surveyed for the occurrence of red yeasts. Subsurface water samples were filtered and used for colony counting and yeast isolation. A preliminary quantitative analysis indicated that total yeast counts ranged between 0 and 250 cells l(-1). A polyphasic approach including physiological and molecular methods was used for the identification of 64 carotenogenic yeast strains. The molecular characterisation of the isolates was based on the mini/microsatellite-primed PCR technique (MSP-PCR) employing the (GTG)5 and the M13 primers. Comparison of representative fingerprints of each group with those of the type strains of pigmented yeasts allowed the expeditious identification of 87.5% isolates. The sequence analysis of the D1/D2 domains of the 26S rDNA was employed to confirm identifications and in the characterization of the unidentified MSP-PCR groups. Teleomorphic yeast species were detected by performing sexual compatibility assays. The isolates corresponded to 6 genera and 15 yeast species, including four new yeast species of the genera Cryptococcus (1), Rhodotorula (1) and Sporobolomyces (2). Rhodotorula mucilaginosa was found in the majority of the samples and represented ca. 50% of the total number of isolates. However, this yeast was not detected in aquatic environments with very low anthropic influence. Other frequent yeast isolates were teleomorphic yeast species of Rhodosporidium babjevae, R. kratochvilovae and Sporidiobolus salmonicolor. This study represents the first report on red yeast occurrence and biodiversity in northwestern Patagonia.\n",
      "Purification and biochemical characterization of a soluble alpha-glucosidase from the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. \n",
      "\t A soluble alpha-glucosidase presumably involved in the general carbohydrate metabolism was purified from E. histolytica trophozoites by a three-step procedure consisting of ion exchange, size exclusion and adsorption chromatographies in columns of Mono Q, Sepharose CL-6B and hydroxyapatite, respectively. After the last step, the enzyme was enriched about 673-fold over the starting material with a yield of 18%. SDS-PAGE revealed the presence in the purified preparations of two polypeptides of comparable intensity exhibiting molecular weights of 43 and 68 kDa. These results and the molecular weight of 243 kDa determined by gel filtration, suggest that the native enzyme is a heterotetramer consisting of two copies of each subunit. Some properties were investigated to determine the role of this activity in glycoprotein processing. Analysis of linkage specificity using a number of substrates indicated a preferential hydrolysis of isomaltose (alpha1,6) with much less activity on nigerose (alpha1,3) and maltose (alpha1,4). Trehalose (alpha1,1), kojibiose (alpha1,2) and cellobiose (beta1,4) were not cleaved at all. As expected, isomaltose competed away hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-glucoside with a higher efficiency than nigerose and maltose. Hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate was competitively inhibited by glucose and 6-deoxy-D-glucose with comparable K(i) values of 0.23 and 0.22 mM, respectively. Sensitivity of the enzyme to the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors 1-deoxynojirimycin, castanospermine and australine largely depended on the substrate utilized to determine activity. 1-Deoxynojirimycin and castanospermine inhibited isomaltose hydrolysis in a competitive manner with K(i) values of 1.2 and 1.5 muM, respectively. The properties of the purified enzyme are consistent with a general glycosidase probably involved in glycogen metabolism.\n",
      "Deletion of BGL2 results in an increased chitin level in the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. \n",
      "\t It is shown that the deletion of BGL2 gene leads to increase in chitin content in the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A part of the additional chitin can be removed from the bgl2Delta cell wall by alkali or trypsin treatment. Chitin synthase 1 (Chs1) activity was increased by 60 % in bgl2Delta mutant. No increase in chitin synthase 3 (Chs3) activity in bgl2Delta cells was observed, while they became more sensitive to Nikkomycin Z. The chitin level in the cell walls of a strain lacking both BGL2 and CHS3 genes was higher than that in chs3Delta and lower than that in bgl2Delta strains. Together these data indicate that the deletion of BGL2 results in the accumulation and abnormal incorporation of chitin into the cell wall of S. cerevisiae, and both Chs1 and Chs3 take part in a response to BGL2 deletion in S. cerevisiae cells.\n",

      "\t As the main nitrogen source in Malassezia (M.) furfur, tryptophan induces the formation of fluorochromes and pigments, which makes the yeast less sensitive towards UV light. For the investigation of the fluorochromes, M. furfur (CBS1878) was incubated at 32 degrees C for 14 days on a pigment-inducing medium, and the agar extract was purified by column chromatography, preparative TLC and HPLC. The structures of the pure metabolites were determined by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. A pale yellow compound eluting from the column with 22% acetonitrile was found to exhibit a strong green-yellow fluorescence. The fluorochrome is a new bisindolyl compound (C(20)H(12)N(2)O(3), MW 328.33) named pityrialactone because of its furan-2,3-dione structure. The UV protective properties (lambda(max) 352, 292, 276, 224 nm) of this metabolite were confirmed in a yeast model. As shown by the fluorescence spectrum, pityrialactone appears to be responsible for the green-yellow fluorescence of pityriasis versicolor lesions under Wood light. Pityrialactone is accompanied by the isomeric bisindolylmaleic anhydride (pityriaanhydride), which has not yet been described as a natural product but is a known intermediate in the total synthesis of bisindolylmaleimides.\n",

      "Solubility enhancement of a hydrophobic flavonoid, luteolin by the complexation with cyclosophoraoses isolated from Rhizobium meliloti. \n",
      "\t A plant flavone, luteolin is a well-known inducer of nod genes in the Rhizobium meliloti. Its poor aqueous solubility was greatly enhanced by the complexation with a family of cyclosophoraoses synthesized in R.meliloti. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis showed that the chemical shifts of the aromatic ring moieties of the luteolin were changed greatly by the complexation with cyclosophoraoses. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis also showed a restricted vibrational pattern in carbonyl stretching region of the luteolin due to the complexation. This effective complex formation of cyclosophoraoses with a plant flavone, luteolin, suggests that rhizobial cyclosophoraoses play an important role as a solubility enhancer of the hydrophobic legume-derived flavonoids.\n",

Cyphellophora guyanensis is compared to the other Cyphellophora species, and the latter genus is compared to Kumbhamaya and Pseudomicrodochium. Kumbhamaya indica, P. fusarioides, and P. suttonii are transferred to Cyphellophora. The phylogenetic relationships of Cyphellophora with other genera of ascomycetes and related mitosporic fungi were inferred from the analysis of the partial nuclear ribosomal DNA SSU sequences data. The analysis supports a placement of Cyphellophora in Chaetothyriales, and probably in the Herpotrichiellaceae\n",

      "\t The occurrence and diversity of yeasts in seawater was investigated in a study site located 20 Km off Faro, Portugal, above the Alvares Cabral Trench. A total of 43 water samples from different layers (above the permanent thermocline, under the thermocline and near the bottom) and directly from the surface, originated 234 isolates. All the isolates were identified using a molecular approach that included, in a first stage, MSP-PCR fingerprinting. A total of 31 MSP-PCR classes were formed, 8 for the pigmented yeasts and 23 for the non-pigmented yeasts. The pink coloured isolates were identified by direct comparison of the new fingerprints with those obtained for representative strains of the various species. For identification of the non-pigmented yeasts, a representative isolate of each MSP-PCR class was selected for sequence analysis and compared with reference sequences. The five most abundant yeast species were Sakaguchia dacryoidea, Pseudozyma aphidis, Rhodosporidium babjevae, R. diobovatum and Debaryomyces hansenii. The distribution of isolates and species in the major taxonomic groups indicated that the number of basidiomycetous yeasts and their diversity are prevalent in relation to their ascomycetous counterpart. Diversity indices were determined and superficial water and water near the bottom had the highest diversity. The sampling effort effectiveness was estimated, and found to correspond to approximately 60% of the species present. MSP-PCR identification proved suitable for pigmented basidiomycetous yeasts and, when used in conjunction with sequence analysis, was effective for the characterization of non-pigmented populations. Our results indicate that the MSP-PCR fingerprinting method is appropriate for the characterization of large groups of isolates due to its simplicity and good reproducibility.\n",

      "\t A collection of transposon-mutagenized strains of Yarrowia lipolytica was screened for wall defects by determination of their sensitivity to calcofluor white. A number of strains were hypersensitive, whereas others were resistant. Different non-allelic mutants displayed increased sensitivity to autolysis and lytic enzymes, independently of whether they were sensitive or resistant to calcofluor white. A thorough analysis of their cell walls revealed minor quantitative alterations, and no significant changes in chitin content. Electrophoretic analysis of wall-bound and excreted proteins proved to be a sensitive method that revealed defects in the cell wall structure of the mutants. Important alterations in the patterns of the wall proteins extracted by SDS or by enzymatic treatments were noticed for the mutants, as compared to the parental strain. Mutants released to the growth medium a larger number of protein species than the parental strain, suggesting impairment in wall assembly of certain polypeptides. Patterns of wall-bound and excreted proteins, as well as alterations in wall chemical composition were not diagnostic of calcofluor white sensitivity or resistance, but were specific for each mutant. Our data show that an increase in either sensitivity or resistance of Y. lipolytica to certain levels of calcofluor is equally indicative of alterations in cell wall structure, independent of chitin levels.\n",

Both parameters were also increased when applying HCl, but Al caused the greater change, so that a distinct discrimination between the effects of aluminium on the one hand and a sole pH-effect on the other hand was possible. The presented results point to an osmo-regulative disorder connected with a malfunction of cell membrane and cell wall, which seems to be a probable mechanism for an Al-toxicity in connection with Arthrobacter sp.

The lipases had the same optimum pH (5.5) and temperature (35 degrees C). The molecular weights of the lipases of F. pedrosoi and P. verrucosa, estimated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, were 25,000 and 20,000, respectively and the enzymes showed broad substrate specificity.

      "\t A total of 748 Salmonella strains (97 serovars) isolated from human (291), animal (119), environmental (141), food (102) and animal feed (95) sources were examined for resistance to 9 antimicrobial agents. Most of the human isolates were from hospitalized patients (282). An overall resistance rate of 98.8% was determined with 100% for human and environmental isolates. Resistance to sulfadiazine (87.7%) was most common, followed by streptomycin (61.2%), ampicillin (39%) and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (37.9%). Fifty one different resistance patterns were identified with Su (164 strains), Su-Sm (122) and Su-Sm-Tc-Cm-Km-Ap-Nx-Gm-Tm (95) predominating, the latter occurring only in human isolates. Multiple resistance was most frequently found among human isolates, particularly in S. derby and S. typhimurium strains.

      "An improved method for light- and electron microscopial studies of nematode/fungal interactions. \n",
      "\t A method is presented that enables studies to be made of single nematode-fungal interactions under conditions where fungal growth at the expense of external nutrients is prevented. The nematophagous fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora was used as a model organism in these studies. The method is based on removal of the traps from the vegetative mycelium, immediately after a nematode was captured and transfer of the trap with the captured nematode into a droplet of sterile distilled water placed in a moisture chamber. In the absence of external nutrients, such isolated traps of A. oligospora were fully effective in penetrating and subsequently digesting the captured nematode. Solely vegetative mycelium was formed at the expense of the digested nematode; this developed from the trap that originally had captured the nematode. One advantage of the present method is that studies on various stages of the nematode-fungal interaction can now be performed under conditions that exclude major influences of external nutrients which otherwise could be communicated to the trap cells by way of the vegetative mycelium.\n",
      "Mechanism of staphylococcal serine proteinase inactivation by lymphocytes and granulocytes. \n",
      "\t Stricking differences were observed in the mechanism of interaction between staphylococcal serine proteinase and surface of human granulocytes or lymphocytes despite the fact that incubation of this enzyme with both types of cells leads to analogical decrease of proteinase activity. Interaction of proteinase with lymphocytes releases peptides smaller than these released spontaneously by non-treated lymphocytes or lymphocytes treated with DFP-proteinase. However, in supernatants of lymphocytes neither complex of proteinase with cell derived molecules nor changes of electrophoretic mobility of proteinase was found. Products of proteinase-lymphocyte reaction have a proliferative effect on intact lymphocytes, which is greater that the one of active proteinase. On the other hand granulocytes are resistant to proteinase and bind active proteinase as well as the DFP-proteinase in the receptor mediated way, followed by endocytosis with the affinity similar to the one in monocytes.\n",

      "\t The regulation of the synthesis of the quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.17) has been studied in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus LMD 79.41, an organism able to oxidize glucose to gluconic acid, but unable to grow on both compounds. Glucose dehydrogenase was synthesized constitutively in both batch and carbon-limited chemostat cultures on a variety of substrates. In acetate-limited chemostat cultures glucose dehydrogenase levels and the glucose-oxidizing capacity of whole cells were dependent on the growth rate. They strongly increased at low growth rates at which the maintenance requirement of the cells had a pronounced effect on biomass yield. Cultures grown on a mixture of acetate and glucose in carbon and energy-limited chemostat cultures oxidized glucose quantitatively to gluconic acid. However, during oxygen-limited growth on this mixture glucose was not oxidized and only very low levels of glucose dehydrogenase were detected in cell-free extracts. After introduction of excess oxygen, however, cultures or washed cell suspensions almost instantaneously gained the capacity to oxidize glucose at a high rate, by an as yet unknown mechanism.\n",
      "Influence of environmental parameters on polyphosphate accumulation in Acinetobacter sp. \n",
      "\t The regulation of and the optimum conditions for polyphosphate accumulation in Acinetobacter sp. were determined. Acinetobacter strain 210A accumulated polyphosphate in the presence of an intra- or extracellular energy source. The accumulation of polyphosphate during endogenous respiration was stimulated by streptomycin and inhibited by KCN. The highest amount of polyphosphate was found in cells in which energy supply was not limited, namely at low growth rates under sulphur limitation, and in the stationary phase of growth when either the nitrogen or the sulphur source was depleted. The phosphorus accumulation was not affected by the pH between 6.5 and 9. There was a pronounced effect of the temperature on phosphorus accumulation but is varied from strain to strain. Acinetobacter strain 210A accumulated more phosphate at low temperatures, strain B8 showed an optimum accumulation at 27.5 degrees C, while strain P accumulated phosphorus independently of the temperature. The optimum temperature for growth of Acinetobacter strains tested ranged from 25 to 33 degrees C, and the optimum pH was between 6 and 9.\n",

CT serotype C and C. psittaci (CP) strain DD34 were investigated using one column only due to the lack of adequate quantities of purified material. Significantly similar fatty acid profiles were observed in the serotypes examined. However, based on the percentage ratio of 13-methyl tetradecanoate (i-15:0) to 12-methyl tetradecanoate (a-15:0), serotypes D and L3, with ratios of 0.18 and 0.19, respectively, could be differentiated from serotypes C and G with ratios of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. CP demonstrated a ratio of 0.4, thus differentiating it from the CT serotypes examined. Fatty acids i-15:0 and a-15:0 were absent in uninfected McCoy cells. Results were significantly comparable in all three capillary columns. This study suggests that GLC could be used for identification and differentiation of Chlamydia serotypes.\n",

The sensitivity of the test was 94% and did not vary much in the hands of four consecutive technicians. In a group of 99 strains tested by one of the technicians non-interpretable results were obtained with 17% of the strains when the test was performed with cells taken from the first or primary plate, against 9% when cells from the secondary (subcultured) plate were used. The lowest number of non-interpretable results was found with a modified Thayer-Martin medium, which also showed the lowest number of false negatives (2%). No non-interpretable results were obtained when the bacterial suspension was first heated to 100 degrees C for 3 min. In a group of 14 recently isolated strains of non-gonococcal species there was only one, preventable, false-positive strain and there were none in a group of 12 meningococci (all of them laboratory strains). In comparison with the fermentation test with Lingelsheim's sugars, the coagglutination test with cells taken from the primary plate with Thayer-Martin medium yielded a conclusive result more often. The test is simple and rapid and does not require special technical equipment.

      "Ethane oxidation by methane-oxidizing bacteria. \n",
      "\t The relationship between the rates of methane and ethane oxidation by washed suspensions of methane-oxidizing bacteria has been investigated. Considerable differences between bacterial strains were observed. Two closely related Methylomonas strains which differed in their oxidizing capacity were further investigated. The low ethane oxidation rate of one strain could be strongly stimulated by the addition of oxidizable co-substrates and the presence of ethane stimulated formate oxidation. The other strain had a much higher ethane oxidation rate and stimulation by co-substrates was negligible. Differences between the levels of dissimilative enzymes in cell-free extracts could not be detected. Attempts to produce extracts with methane mono-oxygenase activity failed. When cells were made permeable with chitosan the results suggested that strains with a low ethane oxidizing capacity obtain the required reductant for the moo-oxygenase from endogenous respiration. In strains with a high ethane oxidation rate, the reductant appears to be derived from oxidation of ethanol or acetaldehyde.\n",
      "Continuous culture studies on the production of staphylocoagulase by Staphylococcus aureus. \n",
      "\t The production of staphylocoagulase was studied with continuous cultures of various S. aureus strains in a simple salts medium supplemented with mannitol, casein hydrolysate and three vitamins. Conditions of low oxygen availability and magnesium-limitation were required for optimal steady-state staphylocoagulase production. It was demonstrated that the specific rate of staphylocoagulase production was dependent on the growth  rate. In two bovine strains, the production rate pattern was similar to that of an inducible enzyme sensitive to catabolite repression, although no specific inductor suppressor could be demonstrated. The human strain, on the other hand, produced staphylocoagulase constitutively. In all strains the specific rate of production of total extracellular protein was strictly proportional to the growth rate. The bovine strains produced 6 times more staphylocoagulase in chemostat culture as compared with batch cultures of the same organisms. It is likely that mannitol functioned as an energy source rather than as a carbon source because it was converted for a major part to acetate and for a minor part to lactate and not to new cell material. Repression and staphylocoagulase production by mannitol, acetate or lactate was not observed. The probable nature of the regulating mechanism(s) underlying staphylocoagulase production is discussed.\n",

M. barkeri can use the substrates simultaneously, but due to acidification or alkalification of the medium during growth on methanol or acetate, respectively, growth and methano-genesis may stop before the substrates are exhausted. Growth and methano-genesis on methanol or acetate are inhibited by the presence of an excess of H2; the inhibition is abolished by the addition of carbon dioxide, which probably serves as an essential source of cell carbon, in the absence of which methano-genesis ceases.\n",

      "\t From cell yields of Thiomicrospira denitrificans grown inthe chemostat at different growth rates under anaerobic conditions a value of 1.4 mM S2O3 = per g dry wt and per h could be calculated for maintenance energy requirements, and of 5.65 dry wt per mole S2O3 = for the true growth yield. Cell yields of Thiomicrospira denitrificans appeared to be almost half of those of Thiobacillus denitrificans. Though in Thiobacillus denitrificans at D = 0.03 h(-1) under anaerobic conditions a value was found of 11.60 g dry wt per mole of thiosulphate used for energetic purposes, a value of 5.72 g dry wt per mole of thiosulphate was found under comparable conditions in Thiomicrospira denitrificans. Under aerobic conditions at D = 0.03 h(-1) values of 18.54 g dry wt per mole of thiosulphate were found in Thiobacillus denitrificans whereas Thiomicrospira denitrificans yielded only 9.38 g dry wt per mole of thiosulphate. As in Thiobacillus denitrificans anaerobic cell yields on sulphide were comparable to those on thiosulphate. Calculations have been made which indicate that the biosynthetic efficiency of Thiomicrospira denitrificans is lower than that of Thiobacillus denitrificans. This can only partly be explained by the absence of adenosine-phosphosulphate (APS) reductase.\n",

      "\t The adsorption of the defective phage PBS Z of Bacillus subtilis has previously been assumed to proceed in two steps, a reversible adsorption of extended phages followed by contraction of the adsorbed particles (Steensma, 1981a). This model, also used for other phages, explained the biphasic character of the adsorption curve, but a discrepancy was found between the calculated and observed concentrations of adsorbed, extended phages. Computer simulations indicated that this might be caused by inhomogeneity of the phage preparations with respect to their adsorption properties and that in that case other models would also fit the experimental data. Discrimination between the models was not possible on the basis of the available information on PBS Z and it was therefore concluded that the values reported previously for the rate constants (Steensma, 1981a) should be used with caution.\n",

The present study was designed to assess the effect of isolated and well characterised indigenous probiotics, Lactobacillus pentosus GSSK2, Lactobacillus fermentum PUM and Lactobacillus plantarum GS26A in high fat diet (HFD) induced metabolic syndrome. It was observed that though supplementation of all three probiotics for 12 weeks to Sprague Dawley rats fed with HFD, ameliorated the anthropometric parameters, but L. pentosus GSSK2 showed maximum reduction in weight gain while maximum decrease in abdominal circumference, Lee's index, BMI and visceral fat deposition was observed in L. plantarum GS26A compared with HFD animals. Further, administration of L. plantarum GS26A to HFD animals led to significant increase in lactic acid bacteria count and lipid excretion in feces followed by L. pentosus GSSK2 and L. fermentum PUM compared with counter controls. Additionally, both L. pentosus GSSK2 and L. plantarum GS26A exhibited improved glucose tolerance, liver biomarkers, alleviated oxidative stress and restored the histoarchitechture of adipose tissue, colon and liver compared with HFD animals. The study highlights the prophylactic potential of isolated probiotics in experimental metabolic syndrome model and revealed that amongst all three probiotics, L. pentosus GSSK2 and L. plantarum GS26A were equally effective and more promising than L. fermentum PUM in improving metabolic dysfunctions and may be employed as functional foods but needs to be correlated clinically.\n",

      "\t Larvae of Hermetia illucens, commonly known as black soldier fly, efficiently convert organic waste into nutrient-rich supplements for different applications. Here we performed a preliminary experiment to investigate the dynamics of the H. illucens gut microbiota and changes in the composition of the bacterial community in the residue of the larval feed during rearing. We furthermore quantified the presence of antibiotic resistance and disinfectant genes in the gut and feed microbiota during the rearing process to elucidate if rearing leads to a reduction, increase, and/or transfer of resistance genes from the feed to larvae and vice versa. We found that the gut and feed residue bacterial communities were distinct throughout the rearing process. The gut microbiome remained more stable compared to the feed residue microbiome varying in both bacterial abundance and community structure during rearing. Antibiotic-resistance genes were present in both, gut and feed residues, with a significant increase in pupae and residue samples taken at the end of the rearing process. Disinfectant-resistance genes were present in the feed residue and even increased during the rearing process but were not transferred to the gut microbiome. We conclude that H. illucens larvae have a stable gut microbiome that does not change significantly over the course of larval development, whereas bacterial communities in the feed residue are strongly affected by rearing. If the presence of antibiotics and disinfectants during rearing, can promote the spread of antibiotic/disinfectant-resistance genes among feed and larvae needs to be evaluated in further experiments.\n",

The yeast strains tested had a positive impact on growth inhibition of all target plant pathogens. The degree of inhibition was more than 50% and varied depending on both the yeast antagonist and the mold. Ethyl esters of medium-chain fatty acids, phenylethyl alcohol, and its acetate ester prevailed among the analyzed volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by yeasts in the presence of the target plant pathogens. Due to the method used, assuming no contact between the antagonist and the pathogen, the antagonistic activity of the yeast strains studied resulted mainly from the production of biologically active VOCs. Moreover, the antagonistic activity was not only restricted to a single plant pathogen but effective towards molds of different genera, making the yeast strains studied very useful for potential application in biological control.\n",
      "The molecular basis of the host specificity of the Rhizobium bacteria. \n",
      "\t The interaction between soil bacteria belonging to the genera Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium and Azorhizobium and leguminous plants results in the induction of a new plant organ, the root nodule. After invading these root nodules via infection threads the bacteria start to fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia which is beneficial for the host plant. This symbiotic interaction is highly host-specific in that each rhizobial strain is able to associate with only a limited number of host plant species. The subject of this presentation is the molecular mechanism by which the bacterium determines its host-specific characteristics. This mechanism appears to be based on at least two stages of molecular signaling between the bacterium and the plant host. In the first stage, flavonoids secreted by the plant root induce, in a host specific way, the transcription of bacterial genes which are involved in nodulation, the so-called nod genes. This leads to the second step of the signaling system: the production and secretion of lipo-oligosaccharide molecules by the Rhizobium bacteria. These signal molecules, which are acylated forms of small fragments of chitin, have various discernable effects on the roots of the host plants. One of these effects is the dedifferentiation of groups of cells located in the cortex which leads to the formation of nodule meristems. In their mitogenic activity the bacterial signals resemble several well-known plant hormones like auxins and cytokinins. However, there are two major differences: (i) the bacterial signals lead to the induction of a specific organ and (ii) they are host-specific in that only the signals produced by compatible bacteria are able to induce meristems. The nod genes determine this stage of host specificity by their essential role in the biosynthesis of the signal molecules. They appear to encode enzymes which are involved in the processes of fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid transfer, chitin synthesis and chitin modification. I will illustrate the statement that the nod gene products are ideal model enzymes for the study of these important processes because they are not needed in the free-living state of the bacteria.\n",

Twenty European hospitals referred a total of 887 urinary tract infection (UTI) isolates to the European SENTRY reference laboratory during the period October-December 1997. Ninety percent of the referred species were represented by Escherichia coli (52%), Enterococcus spp. (12%), Klebsiella spp. (7%), Proteus spp. (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), and Enterobacter spp. (5%). The susceptibility of E. coli isolates to penicillins was less than 60%, while almost all of the isolates were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (98% susceptibility), cephalosporins (98%), and carbapenems (100%). Amikacin was the best aminoglycoside (99.8% susceptibility). The susceptibility to quinolones was only 88-89%, with highest levels of resistance observed for isolates from Portugal, Italy, England, The Netherlands, and some centers in France, Spain, and Poland. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to the newer generations of cephalosporins was 82-95% and to the carbapenems 100%. Amikacin was again the best aminoglycoside (94% susceptibility). The susceptibility of Enterobacter spp. to any beta-lactam antibiotic was poor, except for the carbapenems (100% susceptibility) and cefepime (90% susceptibility), while the susceptibility to aminoglycosides was 80-89%. Proteus spp. showed complete susceptibility to cefepime, ceftriaxone, the carbapenems, and piperacillin/tazobactam, while the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolates was poor, with best results for the carbapenems (susceptibility 89%), piperacillin/tazobactam (susceptibility 84%), and amikacin and ticarcillin (susceptibility to both 80%). Enterococcus spp. showed the highest susceptibility to vancomycin (98%), teicoplanin (98%), and ampicillin (94%).\n",

      "Density gradient separation of active and non-active cells from natural environments. \n",
      "\t We present a method for the selective, physical separation of active and non-active bacterial cells from natural communities. The method exploits the reduction of tetrazolium salts to form insoluble formazan crystals intracellularly in response to the addition of different oxidisable substrates. The intracellular deposition of formazan alters the bouyant density of active cells enabling them to be separated by density gradient centrifugation. The method has been successfully applied to the fractionation and collection of large whole cell sub-populations of active and non-active cells from sea-water samples. Removal of the bands from the density gradient, followed by PCR amplification and DGGE analyses showed distinct differences in the PCR amplicon diversity associated with the active and non-active cell fractions; an indication of changes in bacterial community structure in response to the addition of oxidisable substrate. Thus, based on their in situ respiration potential, the approach enables the cytochemical enrichment and molecular characterisation of mixed bacterial populations in natural environments.\n",

      "\t Respirometric experiments demonstrated that the oxygen uptake by Thiobacillus ferrooxidans strain LR was not inhibited in the presence of 200 mM copper. Copper-treated and untreated cells from this T. ferrooxidans strain were used in growth experiments in the presence of cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc. Growth in the presence of copper was improved by the copper-treated cells. However, no growth was observed for these cells, within 190 h of culture, when cadmium, nickel and zinc were added to the media. Changes in the total protein synthesis pattern were detected by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for T. ferrooxidans LR cells grown in the presence of different heavy metals. Specific proteins were induced by copper (16, 28 and 42 kDa) and cadmium (66 kDa), whereas proteins that had their synthesis repressed were observed for all the heavy metals tested. Protein induction was also observed in the cytosolic and membrane fractions from T. ferrooxidans LR cells grown in the presence of copper. The level of protein phosphorylation was increased in the presence of this metal.\n",
      "Long-term analysis of diesel fuel consumption in a co-culture of Acinetobacter venetianus, Pseudomonas putida and Alcaligenes faecalis. \n",
      "\t The dynamics of a microbial population isolated from superficial waters of Venice Lagoon and the ability to utilise diesel fuel (n-alkanes mixture C12-C28) as the sole carbon and energy source were studied in a long-term reconstruction experiment. The reconstructed microbial population consisted of three bacterial strains belonging to the species Acinetobacter venetianus, Pseudomonas putida, and Alcaligenes faecalis, which were able to oxidise n-alkanes to alkanoates, n-alkanols to alkanoates, or only n-alkanoates, respectively. Three different approaches: plate counting, cell counting by epifluorescence microscopy with DAPI staining, and by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) by using a probe conjugate with fluoresceine isothiocyanate specifically targeted towards the 16S rRNA of bacteria belonging to the genus Acinetobacter were used to monitor the growth of the bacterial population. The growth of A. venetianus was stimulated by the presence of other strains, suggesting a beneficial interaction. After the first week of growth A. venetianus cells formed aggregates, as confirmed by confocal microscopy (CLSM), which allowed them to be distinguished from free cells. A relationship between cell number and measured areas (microm2) per aggregate was found. Each cell presented an average surface of 1.21 microm2. Each aggregate was formed by a cellular monolayer biofilm consisting of up to several thousands of cells. The A. venetianus aggregates increased in number and size over time, but after two weeks fragmentation events, which had a beneficial effect on the growth of P. putida and A. faecalis, occurred.\n",

      "Lactic acid bacteria: inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme in vitro and in vivo. \n",
      "\t A total of 26 strains of wild-type lactic acid bacteria, mainly belonging to Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus helveticus, were assayed in vitro for their ability to produce a milk fermentate with inhibitory activity towards angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). It was clear that the test strains in this study, in general, produce inhibitory substances in varying amounts. Using a spectrophotometric assay based on amino group derivatization with ortho-phthaldialdehyde as a measure of relative peptide content, it was shown that there is a significant correlation between peptide formation and ACE inhibition, indicating that peptide measurement constitutes a convenient selection method. The effect of active fermentates on in vivo ACE activity was demonstrated in normotensive rats. The pressor effect of angiotensin I (0.3 microg/kg) upon intravenous injection was significantly lower when rats were pre-fed with milks fermented using two strains of Lactobacillus helveticus. An increased response to bradykinin (10 microg/kg, intravenously injected) was observed using one of these fermented milks. It is concluded that Lactobacillus helveticus produces substances which in vivo can give rise to an inhibition of ACE. The inhibition in vivo was low compared to what can be achieved with classical ACE inhibitors. The clinical relevance of this finding is discussed. This work is the first in which an effect of fermented milk on ACE in vivo has been demonstrated, measured as decreased ability to convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II.\n",
      "An Azospirillum brasilense Tn5 mutant with modified stress response and impaired in flocculation. \n",
      "\t The analysis of an A. brasilense Tn5 mutant shows significant phenotypic differences compared to the wild type isogenic strain. The transposon was located disrupting an open reading frame of 840 bp (ORF280) which exhibits similarity to the universal stress protein (USP) family. The USP family encompasses proteins that are expressed as a response to cell growth arrest. The mutant revealed a pleiotrophic phenotype with respect to different stress conditions. The ORF mutation results in an increased sensitivity of cells to carbon starvation and heat-shock treatment. However, the mutant strain displays a higher tolerance to oxidative stress agents. In contrast to the isogenic parent strain, colonies of the mutant are weakly stained by Congo red added to solid media and are impaired in flocculation. Scanning electron micrographs revealed that the mutant lacks part of the surface material present as a thick layer of exopolysaccharides on the surface of the wild type cells. The pleiotrophic phenotype revealed for this mutant and the similarity of the C-terminal region of ORF280 to UspA from E. coli indicates that the A. brasilense ORF280 may be a Usp-like protein.\n",
      "Influence of different combinations of bacteria and yeasts in voice prosthesis biofilms on air flow resistance. \n",
      "\t Laryngectomized patients use silicone rubber voice prostheses to rehabilitate their voice. However, biofilm formation limits the lifetime of voice prostheses. The presence of particular combinations of bacterial and yeast strains in voice prosthesis biofilms has been suggested to be crucial for causing valve failure. In order to identify combinations of bacterial and yeast strains causative to failure of voice prostheses, the effects of various combinations of bacterial and yeast strains on air flow resistances of Groningen button voice prostheses were determined. Biofilms were grown on Groningen button voice prostheses by inoculating so-called artificial throats with various combinations of clinically relevant bacterial and yeast strains. After 3 days, all throats were perfused three times daily with 250 ml phosphate buffered saline and at the end of each day the artificial throats were filled with growth medium for half an hour. After 7 days, the air flow resistances of the prostheses were measured. These air flow resistances were expressed relative to the air flow resistances of the same prostheses prior to biofilm formation. This study shows that biofilms causing strong increases in air flow resistance (26 to 28 cm water x s/l) comprised combinations of microorganisms, involving Candida tropicalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Rothia dentocariosa.\n",

      "An assessment of the in vitro antimicrobial effects of two antiepileptic drugs--sodium valproate and phenytoin. \n",
      "\t An incidental observation led to the evaluation of the antimicrobial properties of valproate and phenytoin. In vitro inhibition of Mycobacterium smegmatis, Candida albicans, and other standard test organisms by these two antiepileptic drugs was assessed using the broth microdilution procedure. Fluorescence microscopy (Viability Stains, Molecular Probes Inc.) and cultural techniques were employed to distinguish between microbicidal and microbistatic effects. Phenytoin showed no inhibitory activity against the microbes tested. Sodium valproate, on the other hand, was selectively potent against the yeast strains in a dose-dependent manner (MIC = 10-20 microg ml(-1)). In vitro activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis (70% growth inhibition by 81 microg ml(-1)) was moderate to low while Staphylococcus aureus. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli were not significantly affected. Viability data from fluorescent microscopy and plate cultures correlated well with absorbance (A620nm) growth index, and showed that valproate was microbicidal against susceptible organisms. The mode of action may include blockage of calcium channels and perturbation of membrane potential. This report opens up yet another opportunity for further enquiry into the fundamental mechanisms of drug action and microbial resistance.\n",
      "Relation between phylogeny and physiology in some ascomycetous yeasts. \n",
      "\t The question of whether yeasts with similar physiological properties are closely related has been examined using recently published phylogenetic analyses of 26S domain D1/D2 rDNA nucleotide sequences from all currently recognized ascomycetous yeasts. When apparently unique metabolic pathways are examined, some relationships between physiology and rDNA phylogeny are evident. Most Candida and Pichia species that are able to assimilate methanol as the sole carbon source are in a clade delimited by C. nanospora and C. boidinii. Exceptions are P. capsulata and P. pastoris which are phylogenetically separated from the other methanol-assimilating yeasts. Yeasts subject to the petite mutation, resulting in respiratory deficiency, belong to three different clades, viz, a Saccharomyces clade delimited by S. cerevisiae and S. rosinii, the Dekkera/Brettanomyces clade, and some Schizosaccharomyces species ('Archiascomycete' clade). However, petite mutants were also found in Zygosaccharomyces fermentati and some other more distantly related species. Yeasts able to assimilate n-hexadecane, uric acid or amines as sole carbon source are broadly distributed over the ascomycetous phylogenetic tree. However, species that assimilate adenine as sole carbon source are closely related. Most of these species also assimilated glycine, uric acid, n-hexadecane, putrescine and branched-chain aliphatic compounds such as isobutanol, leucine and isoleucine. Among the Saccharomycetales, species utilizing all or the great majority of these eight compounds are in the Stephanoascus/Arxula/Blastobotrys clade. Candida blankii, which is distantly related to this clade, proved to be an exception and assimilated six of eight of these compounds.\n",

The tested strain formed a distinct phylogenetic line within the evolutionary radiation occupied by the genus Gordonia and was most closely related to G. polyisoprenivorans DSM 44302T. The phenotypic profile of strain 372 readily distinguishes it from representatives of the validly described species of Gordonia. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data show that strain J72 merits recognition as a new species of Gordonia.

Antrodia sinuosa, A. serialis, A. heteromorpha and A. malicola clustered with Perenniporia, Fomitopsis, Piptoporus, Daedalea and Melanoporia within one group of brown rot fungi, while A. carbonica and A. vaillantii clustered with Oligoporus, Gloeophyllum and Auriporia within the other group of brown rot fungi, indicating that Antrodia is a heterogeneous genus and that brown rot fungi have evolved convergently.\n",
      "The costs and benefits of killer toxin production by the yeast Pichia kluyveri. \n",
      "\t Numerous yeast species in many genera are able to produce and excrete extracellular toxic proteins (mycocins) that can kill other specific sensitive yeasts. Natural distributions of killer yeasts suggest that they may be important in maintaining community composition and provide a benefit to the toxin producing cells. The fact that not all yeasts are killers and that polymorphisms exist within some killer species suggests there may be a cost associated with killer toxin production. This study focuses on the costs and benefits associated with toxin production by the yeast Pichia kluyveri. Strains differing in their ability to kill were obtained by tetrad dissection. One parent strain produced spores that exhibited a trade-off between killing ability and intrinsic growth rate. A killer clone from this strain was able to maintain a higher proportion of cells than a non-killer when grown with the same sensitive yeast under laboratory-simulated natural conditions. On the other hand, when grown with a yeast not sensitive to Pichia kluyveri toxin, the non-killer maintained a higher proportion of the total community than did the killer clone. The data support the hypothesis that there are both costs and benefits to producing killer toxin, and based on this, selection may favor different phenotypes in different conditions.\n",

      "\t A sulfate-reducing bacterium, designated as strain R2, was isolated from wastewater of a ball-bearing manufacturing facility in Tomsk, Western Siberia. This isolate was resistant up to 800 mg Cu/l in the growth medium. By comparison, Cu-resistance of reference cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria ranged from 50 to 75 mg Cu/l. Growth experiments with strain R2 showed that Cu was an essential trace element and, on one hand, enhanced growth at concentrations up to 10 mg/l but, on the other hand, the growth rate decreased and lag-period extended at copper concentrations of >50 mg/l. Phenotypic characteristics and a 1078 bp nucleotide sequence of the 16S rDNA placed strain R2 within the genus Desulfovibrio. Desulfovibrio R2 carried at least one plasmid of approximately of 23.1 kbp. A 636 bp fragment of the pcoR gene of the pco operon that encodes Cu resistance was amplified by PCR from plasmid DNA of strain R2. The pco genes are involved in Cu-resistance in some enteric and aerobic soil bacteria. Desulfovibrio R2 is a prospective strain for bioremediation purposes and for developing a homologous system for transformation of Cu-resistance in sulfate-reducing bacteria.\n",
      "Study of thiol consumption by yeast lees. \n",
      "\t The capacity of yeast lees to remove thiols was investigated in a synthetic medium and in wine. In a synthetic medium, yeast lees are able to reduce thiol concentration with a concomitant production of a disulfide. In wine, thiol consumption is lower than in the synthetic medium and no disulfide formation occurs. Though free SH units seem to be partially involved in the thiol consumption process, this does not seem to require molecular oxygen. Since thiol consumption and disulfide formation have been shown to be inhibited by EDTA, it is suggested that metallic cations may be involved in both phenomena.\n",
      "Growth profile of ectomycorrhizal fungal mycelium: emphasis on substrate pH influence. \n",
      "\t A knowledge of behaviour of ectomycorrhizal fungal isolates to substrate pH would help in identifying candidate fungi for plantation programs. Ectomycorrhizal fungus isolates were studied to determine the pH optima for growth, substrate acidification by the culture and the effect of substrate acidification on culture growth. Of the isolates tested, the members of Agaricales (except Laccaria laccata) and Aphyllophorales favored neutral to near neutral pH, while members of the order Sclerodermatales strictly favored acidic pH. The change in substrate pH (deltapH) was maximum at the optimum growth pH for acidophilic isolates but minimum for neutro/basophilic isolates. The experiments indicate that the substrate pH would not only determine the growth rate of the fungus but also limits further proliferation of the fungus in medium. This gives vital information for determining the subculture frequency and for designing substrate parameters for nursery/plantation programs.\n",

Electrophoretic karyotypes of the 41 strains exhibited 4 to 10 chromosomal bands ranging between 0.7 Mb and 4.2 Mb. Among D. hansenii species, the patterns of strains obtained from the CBS collection and cheese isolates differed strongly from D. hansenii var. hansenii CBS767T. Both D. hansenii var. hansenii and D. hansenii var. fabryii showed chromosome length polymorphism. Electrophoretic karyotypes of the D. hansenii strains were analyzed by Southern hybridization with various species-specific probes isolated from D. hansenii var. hansenii CBS767T. Repeated sequences including the F01pro, M18pro, the Ty1-copia retrotransposon Tdh5 and hypothetical telomeric sequence hybridized to several chromosomal bands, while a D1/D2 probe derived from the large ribosomal sub-unit hybridized only to the largest chromosome. Unique probes such as those hybridizing to actin ACT1, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase GPD1 and beta-glucosidase LAC4 encoding genes were assigned to specific chromosomal bands of D. hansenii var. hansenii CBS767T. These probes failed to hybridize to D. hansenii var. fabryii strongly suggesting that strains of this variety actually represent a different taxon.\n",

      "\t PM2 is a bacteriophage which has closed circular double-stranded DNA as a genome, which is the sole source for endonuclease assay for a single strand break in the fmol range. Therefore, it is important to isolate PM2 DNA with low control nicks for the endonuclease assay. Usually, the isolation method of phage DNA is to use ultracentrifugation which takes at least 4 days. In this report, a fast and effective method which takes only 2 days was developed to purify DNA using polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 and the yields of phage DNA isolated by these two methods were compared. The method using PEG 8000 increased the yield of PM2 DNA from 31.2% to 45.2%, and decreased the nick from 17.1% to 13.1%. Recently, the complete PM2 DNA genome sequence of 10,079 bp was published. The exact number of nucleotides of PM2 DNA is important for the correct enzyme assay which measures nicks generated by an endonuclease. The correct calculation of endonuclease activity of rpS3 for nick-circle assay was performed to measure single-strand breaks in this report.\n",

      "Defective zoospore encystment and suppressed cyst germination of Phytophthora palmivora caused by transient leaching treatments. \n",
      "\t The behaviour of encysting zoospores of Phytophthora palmivora during leaching conditions was studied. Zoospores encysted and germinated successfully on polycarbonate membranes after mechanical agitation. Transient (10 min) leaching treatments with nutrient-free buffer underneath the membranes resulted in abnormal encystment and poor germination. The disruption was greatest when leaching was applied during the first minutes after start of encystment and not observed after 20 min. The early sensitivity of cells to leaching coincided with the period when alkali-resistant cell walls were formed (2-6 min after mechanical agitation). Effects of calcium and organic nutrients on encystment during leaching and germination after these treatments were studied. The disruption of encystment by early leaching treatments, but not the suppression of cyst germination, was overcome by adding calcium chloride during mechanical agitation of zoospores. Leaching with calcium containing buffer resulted in suppressed cyst germination as was the case with buffer alone. Leaching with 0.1% peptone containing buffer promoted consistently high encystment and germination.\n",

For this purpose, we first provide a phylogeny of Mycobacteria based on cladistic analyses of 64 different taxa. We then performed a comparative analysis, taking into account both ecological factors and phylogenetic relationships. The GLIM modelling analysis showed that different ecological and phylogenetic factors might be invoked to explain the variation in pathogenicity levels. Interestingly, the most harmful species were shown to be connected with the most diversified habitats. However, the independent contrast analysis revealed that once phylogeny was taken into account, none of the relationships between ecological factors and pathogenicity remained significant, and the pathogenicity appeared to be phylogenetically inherited among mycobacteria. The most pathogen were found in the slow-growing/long helix 18 group, and within this group in the most derived taxa.\n",

      "\t Oceanimonas baumannii ATCC 700832 is a Gram negative marine bacterium capable of utilising phenol as asole carbon source. The ability of the bacterium to tolerate low water activity when utilising either succinate or phenol as a substrate in minimal medium was studied. The membrane lipid and protein composition showed two discreet adaptive phases as salinity increased. Firstly, when NaCl concentration was increased from 0.15% (w/v), the minimum at which growth was observed, to 1% NaCl (w/v), the ratio of zwitterionic to anionic phospholipids in the membrane increased significantly. At the same time the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids and the total membrane protein decreased significantly. The second phase was observed when salinity was increased from 1% to 7% NaCl (w/v) as the ratio of zwitterionic to anionic phospholipids decreased and membrane protein increased. However, the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids was unaffected. Salinity also affected the tolerance of cultures to elevated levels of phenol. Cultures grown in 0.15% NaCl (w/v) could tolerate 12 mM phenol, whereas in the presence of 1% NaCl (w/v) cultures continued to grow in up to 20 mM phenol and in 7% NaCl (w/v) cultures 8 mM phenol could be tolerated. Changes to the composition of the membrane phospholipids and fatty acids were also observed when phenol concentrations were at the maximum that could be tolerated. Under such conditions the ratio of zwitterionic to anionic phospholipids decreased twofold compared to cultures utilising 4 mM phenol as the substrate, in all salinities except in 7% NaCl (w/v) cultures, where there was no significant effect. The ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids increased significantly in all salinities compared to cultures grown with 4 mM phenol.\n",

      "\t Analysis of ITS rDNA of the black yeast Exophiala dermatitidis revealed a close phylogenetic relationship to the meristematic fungus Sarcinomyces phaeomuriformis. As most strains of S. phaeomuriformis have a yeast-like phenotype corresponding to the anamorph genus Exophiala, a new combination in Exophiala is proposed. On the basis of ITS sequence, M-13 fingerprint and SSU intron data, two main entities could be distinguished within E. dermatitidis. One of these (B) contained prevalently strains from environmental sources, while the other (A) mainly comprised strains from clinical sources. This may be due to a difference in virulence. All strains from severe brain and disseminated infections in East Asia clustered in group A. However, strains of group A caused a relatively mild fungemia in patients outside East Asia.\n",

      "\t Somatic coliphages detected by Escherichia coli strain WG5 have been proposed as potential indicators of water quality. Their potential replication in the water environment is considered a drawback for their use as indicators. However, the contribution of replication outside the gut to the total numbers has never been quantified. It has not been determined either the fraction of bacterial strains that might support replication of phages detected by strain WG5 in the water environment. We examined the sensitivity of 291 host strains to 25 phages by streaking slants of the presumptive host strain onto an agar layer that contains bacteriophages, which gives a total of 7275 combinations (sensitivity tests). Only a 3.02% of the tests showed sensitivity. Additionally, six environmental strains were used as hosts to count phages in sewage and seawater. Phages isolated on these strains were used to infect strain WG5. The environmental strains detected 1 log10 fewer phages than strain WG5 in sewage and seawater. The fraction of phages that were detected by the six strains and that also infected strain WG5 ranged from < 0.07% to < 2.0% of the total amount of bacteriophages detected by strain WG5 in the same samples. Our results confirm that less than 3% of naturally occurring hosts support replication of phages infecting E. coli. We conclude that the contribution of replication to the number of somatic coliphages detected in the aquatic environment is negligible.\n",

      "\t A characterization of a non-pigment producing mutant Monascus purpureus M12 compared with its parental strain Monascus purpureus Went CBS 109.07 has been performed aiming to investigate the relation between pigment biosynthesis and other characteristics of these fungi. A comparison has been made of morphological features, some physiological properties and biochemical activities of both strains. The albino mutant exhibits an anamorph life cycle, high conidia forming capability, slower radial growth rate and temperature sensitivity. The assimilation capacity of both strains for mono-, disaccharides and some alcohols is in the same range (Yx/c 0.2 - 0.35), while the red strain has a higher fermentation capacity. In a selected albino mutant, the growth rate, metabolic activity and capacity for production of typical for Monascus fungi secondary metabolites were reduced considerably. Hydrolytic activity towards natural substrates expressed through glucoamylase and protease was approximately 10 fold lower in the non pigment producing strain (0.05 - 0.08 U/mg protein and 0.01 - 0.07 U/mg protein respectively) compared with the red one. Important qualitative differences between both strains was found in fatty acid composition and in the production of citrinin and monacolin. The mutant strain possessed C17, C20 and C22 fatty acids and did not produce citrinin.\n",
      "Comparison of three molecular methods for typing Aeromonas popoffii isolates. \n",
      "\t Three typing methods, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region (ISR), PCR amplification of the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) and of the repetitive extragenic palindromic units (REP), were evaluated for typing 26 isolates of Aeromonas popoffii from different geographical origins. When the methods were independently studied, ERIC showed the highest discriminatory power. When the methods were combined, the best combination of two methods was ERIC with REP since strains showed a tendency to cluster according to their geographical origin. However, this tendency was reinforced with the addition of ISR-RFLP.\n",

      "phoR1, a gene encoding a new histidine protein kinase Myxococcus xanthus. \n",
      "\t A soil bacterium able to undergo multicellular development and a coordinated gliding in swarms, requires an accurate regulatory network of phosphorelay proteins. Inorganic phosphate is a limiting nutrient in soil and its importance in regulation is critical. As a step towards studying phosphate regulation and its influence in the developmental process in this bacterium, we screened a Myxococcus xanthus library for clones with phosphatase activity, and found four different ones. The deduced sequence of one of the cloned inserts is similar to that of the classic transmembrane histidine protein kinase of the sensor family of the two-component signal transduction systems with a high sequence similarity to the sensor kinase in the Pho regulon of Bacillus subtilis PhoR. This gene has been named phoR1 and its deduced amino acid sequence consists of 455 residues with a predicted molecular mass of 48.5 kDa. The M. xanthus PhoR1 deduced sequence contains all the characteristic histidine protein kinase motifs in the same order and with the same spacing. A hydropathy profile indicates two membrane-spanning segments located at the extreme N-terminus, according to the putative sensor role of this domain. A gene-disrupted mutant is unable to produce normal mature fruiting bodies and produces fewer spores.\n",
      "From DNA sequence to application: possibilities and complications. \n",
      "\t The development of sophisticated genetic tools during the past 15 years have facilitated a tremendous increase of fundamental and application-oriented knowledge of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and their bacteriophages. This knowledge relates both to the assignments of open reading frames (ORF's) and the function of non-coding DNA sequences. Comparison of the complete nucleotide sequences of several LAB bacteriophages has revealed that their chromosomes have a fixed, modular structure, each module having a set of genes involved in a specific phase of the bacteriophage life cycle. LAB bacteriophage genes and DNA sequences have been used for the construction of temperature-inducible gene expression systems, gene-integration systems, and bacteriophage defence systems. The function of several LAB open reading frames and transcriptional units have been identified and characterized in detail. Many of these could find practical applications, such as induced lysis of LAB to enhance cheese ripening and re-routing of carbon fluxes for the production of a specific amino acid enantiomer. More knowledge has also become available concerning the function and structure of non-coding DNA positioned at or in the vicinity of promoters. In several cases the mRNA produced from this DNA contains a transcriptional terminator-antiterminator pair, in which the antiterminator can be stabilized either by uncharged tRNA or by interaction with a regulatory protein, thus preventing formation of the terminator so that mRNA elongation can proceed. Evidence has accumulated showing that also in LAB carbon catabolite repression in LAB is mediated by specific DNA elements in the vicinity of promoters governing the transcription of catabolic operons. Although some biological barriers have yet to be solved, the vast body of scientific information presently available allows the construction of tailor-made genetically modified LAB. Today, it appears that societal constraints rather than biological hurdles impede the use of genetically modified LAB.\n",
      "Low-redundancy sequencing of the entire Lactococcus lactis IL1403 genome. \n",
      "\t Lactococcus lactis is an AT-rich gram positive bacterium phylogenetically close to the genus Streptococcus. Various strains of L. lactis are used in dairy industry as starters for cheese making. L. lactis is also one of the well characterized laboratory microorganisms, widely used for studies on physiology of lactic acid bacteria. We describe here a low redundancy sequence of the genome of the strain L. lactis IL1403. The strategy which we followed to determine the sequence consists of two main steps. First, a limited number of plasmids and lambda-phages that carry random segments of the genome were sequenced. Second, sequences of the inserts were used for production of novel sequencing templates by applying Multiplex Long Accurate PCR protocols. Using of these PCR products allowed to determine the sequence of the entire 2.35 Mb genome with a very low redundancy, close to 2. The error rate of the sequence is estimated to be below 1%. The correctness of the sequence assembly was confirmed by PCR amplification of the entire L. lactis IL1403 genome, using a set of 266 oligonucleotides. Anotation of the sequence was undertaken by using automatic gene prediction computer tools. This allowed to identify 1495 protein-encoding genes, to locate them on the genome map and to classify their functions on the basis of homology to known proteins. The function of about 700 genes expected to encode proteins that lack homologs in data bases cannot be reliably predicted in this way. The approach which we used eliminates high redundancy sequencing and mapping efforts, needed to obtain detailed and comprehensive genetic and physical maps of a bacterium. Availability of detailed genetic and physical maps of the L. lactis IL1403 genome provides many entries to study metabolism and physiology of bacteria from this group. The presence of 42 copies of five different IS elements in the IL1403 genome confirms the importance of these elements for genetic exchange in Lactococci. These include two previously unknown elements, present at seven and fifteen copies and designated IS1077 and IS983, respectively. Five potential or rudimentary prophages were identified in the genome by detecting clusters of phage-related genes. The metabolic and regulatory potential of L. lactis was evaluated by inspecting gene sets classified into different functional categories. L. lactis has the genetic potential to synthesise 20 standard amino acids, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and at least four cofactors. Some of these metabolites, which are usually present in chemically defined media, can probably be omitted. About twenty compounds can be used by L. lactis as a sole carbon source. Some 83 regulators were revealed, indicating a regulatory potential close to that of Haemophilus influenzae, a bacterium with a similar genome size. Unexpectedly, L. lactis has a complete set of late competence genes, which may have concerted transcriptional regulation and unleadered polycistronic mRNAs. These findings open new possibilities for developing genetic tools, useful for studies of gene regulation in AT-rich gram positive bacteria and for engineering of new strains for the diary industry.\n",
      "Group II introns and expression of conjugative transfer functions in lactic acid bacteria. \n",
      "\t The homologous lactococcal conjugative elements pRS01 and the sex factor of Lactococcus lactis strain 712 both contain a Group II intron within a gene believed to encode a conjugative relaxase enzyme. This enzyme is responsible for nicking of DNA at the origin of transfer (oriT) sequence of the sex factor DNA to initiate the strand transfer process. Group II introns have been studied in eukaryotes, and several of these elements in yeast mitochondrial genes have received considerable attention. These introns are relatively large in size and generally encode a protein within the intron sequence. In addition to splicing activity. Group II introns are mobile genetic elements. The intron-encoded proteins (IEPs) contain endonuclease and reverse transcriptase domains believed to play an enzymatic role in genetic mobility reactions, while a putative maturase domain is thought to promote splicing by stabilizing the folding of the intron RNA into an active ribozyme structure which carries out the splicing reaction. The lactococcal introns represent the first examples of Group II introns shown to be functional in vivo in prokaryotes. Because of the advantages of a bacterial system for genetic and molecular studies, the Ll.ltrB intron from pRS01 has attracted the attention of several laboratories interested in Group II intron biology. Recently, it has been shown that the system can be adapted to function in Escherichia coli (although at somewhat reduced efficiency). In addition, it has been recently proven that the best studied form of mobility, the homing of the intron into an intronless allele of the cognate exon gene, occurs via an RNA intermediate and does not require DNA homology or generalized host recombination functions. Current efforts are analysis of the role Ll.ltrB splicing in regulating expression of pRS01 conjugation functions. The lactococcal Group II introns represent the first demonstrated genetically mobile prokaryotic retroelements, and they also have considerable potential as genetic engineering tools for Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and other organisms.\n",
      "Bacteriophage defence systems in lactic acid bacteria. \n",
      "\t The study of the interactions between lactic acid bacteria and their bacteriophages has been a vibrant and rewarding research activity for a considerable number of years. In the more recent past, the application of molecular genetics for the analysis of phage-host relationships has contributed enormously to the unravelling of specific events which dictate insensitivity to bacteriophage infection and has revealed that while they are complex and intricate in nature, they are also extremely effective. In addition, the strategy has laid solid foundations for the construction of phage resistant strains for use in commercial applications and has provided a sound basis for continued investigations into existing, naturally-derived and novel, genetically-engineered defence systems. Of course, it has also become clear that phage particles are highly dynamic in their response to those defence systems which they do encounter and that they can readily adapt to them as a consequence of their genetic flexibility and plasticity. This paper reviews the exciting developments that have been described in the literature regarding the study of phage-host interactions in lactic acid bacteria and the innovative approaches that can be taken to exploit this basic information for curtailing phage infection.\n",
      "Acquired antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from food. \n",
      "\t Acquired antibiotic resistance, i.e. resistance genes located on conjugative or mobilizable plasmids and transposons can be found in species living in habitats (e.g. human and animal intestines) which are regularly challenged with antibiotics. Most data are available for enterococci and enteric lactobacilli. Raw material from animals (milk and meat) which are inadvertantly contaminated with fecal matters during production will carry antibiotic resistant lactic acid bacteria into the final fermented products such as raw milk cheeses and raw sausages. The discovered conjugative genetic elements of LAB isolated from animals and food are very similar to elements studied previously in pathogenic streptococci and enterococci, e.g. theta-type replicating plasmids of the pAMbeta1, pIP501-family, and transposons of the Tn916-type. Observed resistance genes include known genes like tetM, ermAM, cat, sat and vanA. A composite 29,871 bp resistance plasmid detected in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolated from a raw milk soft cheese contains tetS previously described in Listeria monocytogenes, cat and str from Staphylococcus aureus. Three out of five IS elements on the plasmid are almost or completely identical to IS1216 present in the vanA resistance transposon Tn1546. These data support the view that in antibiotic challenged habitats lactic acid bacteria like other bacteria participate in the communication systems which transfer resistance traits over species and genus borders. The prevalence of such bacteria with acquired resistances like enterococci is high in animals (and humans) which are regularly treated with antibiotics. The transfer of antibiotic resistant bacteria from animals into fermented and other food can be avoided if the raw substrate milk or meat is pasteurized or heat treated. Antibiotic resistance traits as selectable markers in genetic modification of lactic acid bacteria for different purposes are presently being replaced, e.g. by metabolic traits to generate food-grade vectors.\n",

This comparative analysis has led to the prediction of a number of different domains in these cell-envelope proteinases, and their homology, characteristics and putative function are described. These domains include, starting from the N-terminus, a pre-pro-domain for secretion and activation, a serine protease domain (with a smaller inserted domain), two large middle domains A and B of unknown but possibly regulatory function, a helical spacer domain, a hydrophilic cell-wall spacer or attachment domain, and a cell-wall anchor domain. Not all domains are present in each cell-envelope proteinase, suggesting that these multi-domain proteins are the result of gene shuffling and domain swapping during evolution.\n",
      "Bacteriocins: mechanism of membrane insertion and pore formation. \n",
      "\t Lactic acid bacteria produce several types of pore forming peptides. Class I bacteriocins are lantibiotics that contain (methyl)lanthionine residues that may form intramolecular thioether rings. These peptides generally have a broad spectrum of activity and form unstable pores. Class II bacteriocins are small, heat stable peptides mostly with a narrow spectrum of activity. Most bacteriocins interact with anionic lipids that are abundantly present in the membranes of gram-positive bacteria. 'Docking molecules' may enhance the conductivity and stability of lantibiotic pores, while 'receptors' in the target membrane may determine specificity of class II bacteriocins. Insertion into the membrane of many bacteriocins is proton motive force driven. Lantibiotics may form pores according to a 'wedge-like' model, while class II bacteriocins may enhance membrane permeability either by the formation of a 'barrel stave' pore or by a 'carpet' mechanism.\n",
      "Intestinal microflora and the interaction with immunocompetent cells. \n",
      "\t The intestinal mucosal surface is colonised by the comensal microflora that attains very high numbers of bacterial cells in the distal intestine, more specifically in the colon. At the same time these extensive areas are the interface with the external environment, through which most pathogens initiate infectious processes in mammals. Intestinal mechanisms of defense need to discriminate accurately between comensal, symbiotic microflora, and exogenous pathogens. Today we do not fully understand the essence of the mechanism of discrimination but, probably, innate as well as adaptive immune responses participate in this process. We have explored, in in vitro models, the capacity of mucosal immunocompetent cells to discriminate amongst signals delivered by different types of bacteria. We have found at least two different patterns of innate response to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and within this last group big differences are observed between species. We have only worked with non-pathogenic bacteria in what may represent the modulation of the physiological host status. The understanding of these modulatory functions could render a unique possibility for the use of food-borne bacteria to prevent or correct intestinal problems associated with food allergy, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmunity.\n",
      "The biosynthesis and functionality of the cell-wall of lactic acid bacteria. \n",
      "\t The cell wall of lactic acid bacteria has the typical gram-positive structure made of a thick, multilayered peptidoglycan sacculus decorated with proteins, teichoic acids and polysaccharides, and surrounded in some species by an outer shell of proteins packed in a paracrystalline layer (S-layer). Specific biochemical or genetic data on the biosynthesis pathways of the cell wall constituents are scarce in lactic acid bacteria, but together with genomics information they indicate close similarities with those described in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, with one notable exception regarding the peptidoglycan precursor. In several species or strains of enterococci and lactobacilli, the terminal D-alanine residue of the muramyl pentapeptide is replaced by D-lactate or D-serine, which entails resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. Diverse physiological functions may be assigned to the cell wall, which contribute to the technological and health-related attributes of lactic acid bacteria. For instance, phage receptor activity relates to the presence of specific substituents on teichoic acids and polysaccharides; resistance to stress (UV radiation, acidic pH) depends on genes involved in peptidoglycan and teichoic acid biosynthesis; autolysis is controlled by the degree of esterification of teichoic acids with D-alanine; mucosal immunostimulation may result from interactions between epithelial cells and peptidoglycan or teichoic acids.\n",

      "\t The conversion of peptides to free amino acids and their subsequent utilization is a central metabolic activity in prokaryotes. At least 16 peptidases from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been characterized biochemically and/or genetically. Among LAB, the peptidase systems of Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactococcus lactis have been examined in greatest detail. While there are homologous enzymes common to both systems, significant differences exist in the peptidase complement of these organisms. The characterization of single and multiple peptidase mutants indicate that these strains generally exhibit reduced specific growth rates in milk compared to the parental strains. LAB can also catabolize amino acids produced by peptide hydrolysis. While the catabolism of amino acids such as Arg, Thr, and His is well understood, few other amino acid catabolic pathways from lactic acid bacteria have been characterized in significant detail. Increasing research attention is being directed toward elucidating these pathways as well as characterizing their physiological and industrial significance.\n",
      "Bioactive peptides encrypted in milk proteins: proteolytic activation and thropho-functional properties. \n",
      "\t The bioactivities of peptides encrypted in major milk proteins are latent until released and activated by enzymatic proteolysis, e.g. during gastrointestinal digestion or food processing. The proteolytic system of lactic acid bacteria can contribute to the liberation of bioactive peptides. In vitro, the purified cell wall proteinase of Lactococcus lactis was shown to liberate oligopeptides from beta- and alpha-caseins which contain amino acid sequences present in casomorphins, casokinines, and immunopeptides. The further degradation of these peptides by endopeptidases and exopeptidases of lactic acid bacteria could lead to the liberation of bioactive peptides in fermented milk products. However, the sequences of practically all known biologically active peptides can also be cleaved by peptidases from lactic acid bacteria. Activated peptides are potential modulators of various regulatory processes in the body: Opioid peptides are opioid receptor ligands which can modulate absorption processes in the intestinal tract, angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides are hemodynamic regulators and exert an antihypertensive effect, immunomodulating casein peptides stimulate the activities of cells of the immune system, antimicrobial peptides kill sensitive microorganisms, antithrombotic peptides inhibit aggregation of platelets and caseinophosphopeptides may function as carriers for different minerals, especially calcium. Bioactive peptides can interact with target sites at the luminal side of the intestinal tract. Furthermore, they can be absorbed and then reach peripheral organs. Food-derived bioactive peptides are claimed to be health enhancing components which can be used for functional food and pharmaceutical preparations.\n",
      "Sulfur metabolism in bacteria associated with cheese. \n",
      "\t Metabolism of sulfur in bacteria associated with cheese has long been a topic of interest. Volatile sulfur compounds, specifically methanethiol, are correlated to desirable flavor in Cheddar cheese, but their definitive role remains elusive. Only recently have enzymes been found that produce this compound in bacteria associated with cheese making. Cystathionine beta- and gamma-lyase are found in lactic acid bacteria and are capable of producing methanethiol from methionine. Their primary function is in the metabolism of cysteine. Methionine gamma-lyase produces methanethiol from methionine at a higher efficiency than the cystathionine enzymes. This enzyme is found in brevibacteria, bacilli, and pseudomonads. Addition of brevibacteria containing this enzyme improves Cheddar cheese flavor. Despite recent progress in sulfur metabolism more information is needed before cheese flavor associated with sulfur can be predicted or controlled.\n",

      "\t The enteric flora comprise approximately 95% of the total number of cells in the human body and are capable of eliciting immune responses while also protecting against microbial pathogens. However, the resident bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of several chronic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The University College Cork-based Probiotic Research Group has successfully isolated and identified lactic acid bacteria (LAB) which exhibit beneficial probiotic traits. These characteristics include the demonstration of bile tolerance; acid resistance; adherence to host epithelial tissue; and in vitro antagonism of potentially-pathogenic micro-organisms or those which have been implicated in promoting inflammation. The primary objective of this report is to describe the strategy adopted for the selection of potentially effective probiotic bacteria. The study further describes the evaluation of two members of the resulting panel of micro-organisms (Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius UCC118 and Bifidobacterium longum infantis 35624) under in vitro conditions and throughout in vivo murine and human feeding trials. Specifically, an initial feeding study completed in Balb/c mice focused upon (i) effective delivery of the probiotic micro-organisms to the GIT and evaluation of the ability of the introduced strains to survive transit through, and possibly colonise, the murine GIT; (ii) accepting the complexity of the hostile GIT and faecal environments, development of a method of enumerating the introduced bacterial strains using conventional microbiological techniques; and (iii) assessment of the effects of administered bacterial strains on the numbers of specific recoverable indigenous bacteria in the murine GIT and faeces. Additional research, exploiting the availability of murine models of inflammatory bowel disease, demonstrated the beneficial effects of administering probiotic combinations of Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118 and Bifidobacterium longum infantis 35624 in prevention of illness-related weight loss. A further ethically-approved feeding trial, successfully conducted in 80 healthy volunteers, demonstrated that yoghurt can be used as a vehicle for delivery of Lactobacillus salivarius strain UCC118 to the human GIT with considerable efficacy in influencing gut flora and colonisation.\n",

      "\t Properly formulated probiotic-containing foods offer consumers a low risk, low cost dietary component that has the potential to promote health in a variety of ways. Several such products are available commercially, although markets in Japan and Europe are more developed than in the USA. Once healthful attributes of a probiotic product have been identified, there remain microbiological, product, regulatory and labeling issues to be addressed prior to marketing. Microbiological and product issues include safety, effective scale-up for manufacturing, definition of probiotic activity, probiotic stability in the product over the course of product manufacture, shelf-life and consumption, definition of effective dose and target population(s), and development of quality assurance approaches. Examples of probiotic-containing foods are given. Regulatory and labeling issues are complicated because they differ for each country, but are likewise critical because they provide the means for communication of the product benefits to the consumer. The regulatory climate worldwide appears to be one of caution about overstating the benefits of such products but at the same time not preventing corporate commitment to marketing.\n",
      "Lactic acid bacteria in the quality improvement and depreciation of wine. \n",
      "\t The winemaking process includes two main steps: lactic acid bacteria are responsible for the malolactic fermentation which follows the alcoholic fermentation by yeasts. Both types of microorganisms are present on grapes and on cellar equipment. Yeasts are better adapted to growth in grape must than lactic acid bacteria, so the alcoholic fermentation starts quickly. In must, up to ten lactic acid bacteria species can be identified. They belong to the Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc and Oenococcus genera. Throughout alcoholic fermentation, a natural selection occurs and finally the dominant species is O. oeni, due to interactions between yeasts and bacteria and between bacteria themselves. After bacterial growth, when the population is over 10(6) CFU/ml, malolactic transformation is the obvious change in wine composition. However, many other substrates can be metabolized. Some like remaining sugars and citric acid are always assimilated by lactic acid bacteria, thus providing them with energy and carbon. Other substrates such as some amino acids may be used following pathways restricted to strains carrying the adequate enzymes. Some strains can also produce exopolysaccharides. All these transformations greatly influence the sensory and hygienic quality of wine. Malic acid transformation is encouraged because it induces deacidification. Diacetyl produced from citric acid is also helpful to some extent. Sensory analyses show that many other reactions change the aromas and make malolactic fermentation beneficial, but they are as yet unknown. On the contrary, an excess of acetic acid, the synthesis of glucane, biogenic amines and precursors of ethylcarbamate are undesirable. Fortunately, lactic acid bacteria normally multiply in dry wines; moreover some of these activities are not widespread. Moreover, the most striking trait of wine lactic acid bacteria is their capacity to adapt to a hostile environment. The mechanisms for this are not yet completely elucidated. Molecular biology has provided some explanations for the behaviour and the metabolism of bacteria in wine. New tools are now available to detect the presence of desirable and undesirable strains. Even if much remains unknown, winemakers and oenologists can nowadays better control the process. By acting upon the diverse microflora and grape musts, they are more able to produce healthy and pleasant wines.\n",
      "Multidrug resistance in lactic acid bacteria: molecular mechanisms and clinical relevance. \n",
      "\t The active extrusion of cytotoxic compounds from the cell by multidrug transporters is one of the major causes of failure of chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor cells and of infections by pathogenic microorganisms. The secondary multidrug transporter LmrP and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) type multidrug transporter LmrA in Lactococcus lactis are representatives of the two major classes of multidrug transporters found in pro- and eukaryotic organisms. Therefore, knowledge of the molecular properties of LmrP and LmrA will have a wide significance for multidrug transporters in all living cells, and may enable the development of specific inhibitors and of new drugs which circumvent the action of multidrug transporters. Interestingly, LmrP and LmrA are transport proteins with very different protein structures, which use different mechanisms of energy coupling to transport drugs out of the cell. Surprisingly, both proteins have overlapping specificities for drugs, are inhibited by the same set of modulators, and transport drugs via a similar transport mechanism. The structure-function relationships that dictate drug recognition and transport by LmrP and LmrA will represent an intriguing new area of research.\n",
      "Developing applications for lactococcal bacteriocins. \n",
      "\t While much of the applied research carried out to date with bacteriocins has concerned nisin, lactococci produce other bacteriocins with economic potential. An example is the two component bacteriocin lacticin 3147, which is active over a wide pH range and has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive bacteria. Since the genetic determinants for lacticin 3147 are encoded on a large self-transmissible plasmid, the bacteriocin genes may be conveniently transferred to different lactococcal starters. The resulting food-grade strains can then be used to make a significant impact on the safety and quality of a variety of fermented foods, through the inhibition of undesirable microflora. The bacteriocin is heat stable so it can also be used as an ingredient in a powdered form such as a spray-dried fermentate. Given the observation that lacticin 3147 is effective at physiological pH, there is also considerable potential for biomedical applications. Field trials have demonstrated its efficacy in the prevention of mastitis infections in dairy cows. In contrast to lacticin 3147, the lactococcin bacteriocins A, B and M have a narrow spectrum of activity limited to lactococci. Strains which produce these inhibitors can be exploited in the acceleration of cheese ripening by assisting the premature lysis of starter cultures.\n",

      "\t Over the last years, important advances have been made in the study of the production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) by several lactic acid bacteria, including Lactococcus lactis. From different EPS-producing lactococcal strains the specific eps gene clusters have been characterised. They contain eps genes, which are involved in EPS repeating unit synthesis, export, polymerisation, and chain length determination. The function of the glycosyltransferase genes has been established and the availability of these genes opened the way to EPS engineering. In addition to the eps genes, biosynthesis of EPS requires a number of housekeeping genes that are involved in the metabolic pathways leading to the EPS-building blocks, the nucleotide sugars. The identification and characterisation of several of these housekeeping genes (galE, galU, rfbABCD) allows the design of metabolic engineering strategies that should lead to increased EPS production levels by L. lactis. Finally, model development has been initiated in order to predict the physicochemical consequences of the addition of a EPS to a product.\n",

This paper reviews five different types of anchoring domains that have been explored for their efficiency in attaching hybrid proteins to the cell membrane or cell wall of LAB. The most exploited anchoring regions are those with the LPXTG box that bind the proteins in a covalent way to the cell wall. In recent years, two new modes of cell wall protein anchoring have been studied and these may provide new approaches in surface display. The important progress that is being made with cell surface display of chimaeric proteins in the areas of vaccine development and enzyme- or whole-cell immobilisation is highlighted.\n",

      "\t Colorectal cancer is one of the most important causes of cancer morbidity and mortality in Western countries. While a myriad of healthful effects have been attributed to the probiotic lactic acid bacteria, perhaps the most controversial remains that of anticancer activity. It should be pointed out already at this point that there is no direct experimental evidence for cancer suppression in humans as a result of consumption of lactic cultures in fermented or unfermented dairy products. However, there is a wealth of indirect evidence, based largely on laboratory studies, in the literature. The precise mechanisms by which lactic acid bacteria may inhibit colon cancer are presently unknown. However, such mechanisms might include: enhancing the host's immune response; binding and degrading potential carcinogens; quantitative and/or qualitative alterations in the intestinal microflora incriminated in producing putative carcinogen(s) and promoters (e.g. bile acid-degrading bacteria); producing antitumorigenic or antimutagenic compounds in the colon; alteration of the metabolic activities of intestinal microflora; alteration of physicochemical conditions in the colon; effects on physiology of the host. These potential mechanisms are discussed in the present paper.\n",

Furthermore, when the B. breve was given to infants from an infant home, there was a significant reduction of the frequency of rotavirus shedding in stool samples during the administration of the bacteria. It was also found, again using mice, that oral administration of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) stimulated type 1 helper T (Th1) cells, activated the cellular immune system and inhibited incidence of tumors and IgE production. These results demonstrated that these two strains of lactic acid bacteria modulated the different immune systems each in its own way and prevented against various diseases.\n",
      "Non-dairy lactic fermentations: the cereal world. \n",
      "\t Sourdough is the foremost cereal fermentation performed in a variety of technologies with almost any cereal. The lactobacilli studied most intensely include Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, L. reuteri and L. pontis isolated from traditional and modern rye and wheat fermentations. Molecular biology tools are available for their rapid identification and monitoring throughout a process. The currently available insight on their metabolism can be used to explain their prevalence in this environment and their interactions. Key genes of the sugar degradation pathway were cloned and characterised from L. sanfranciscensis. In addition some strains were found to have special properties including the production of antagonistic compounds or the adhesion to human intestinal cells.\n",
      "The Streptomyces violaceusniger clade: a home for Streptomycetes with rugose ornamented spores. \n",
      "\t The taxonomic status of 16 strains received as Streptomyces hygroscopicus, Streptomyces melanosporofaciens, Streptomyces sparsogenes, Streptomyces sporoclivatus and Streptomyces violaceusniger was evaluated in a polyphasic study. Eleven of the organisms formed a distinct clade in the Streptomyces 16S rRNA gene tree with the type strains of Streptomyces asiaticus, Streptomyces cangkringensis, Streptomyces indonesiensis, Streptomyces javensis, Streptomyces malaysiensis, Streptomyces rhizosphaericus, Streptomyces yatensis and Streptomyces yogyakartensis, the members of this group produced rugose ornamented spores in spiral spore chains. The eleven strains were assigned to three established and four novel species, namely Streptomyces albiflaviniger sp. nov., Streptomyces demainii sp. nov., Streptomyces geldanamycininus sp. nov., Streptomyces griseiniger sp. nov., and Streptomyces hygroscopicus, Streptomyces melanosporofaciens and Streptomyces violaceusniger. It is also proposed that S. sporoclivatus becomes a subjective synonym of S. melanosporofaciens. S. sparsogenes NRRL 2940(T), which produced ridged ornamented spores in spiral spore chains, formed a distinct phyletic line in the Streptomyces 16S rRNA gene tree and was readily distinguished from the other strains using a range of phenotypic properties. S. violaceusniger strains NRRL 8097, NRRL B-5799, NRRL 2834 and ISP 5182 fell outside the S. violaceusniger 16S rRNA gene clade and formed either smooth or ridged ornamented spores in either flexuous or spiral spore chains. These organisms were distinguished from one another and from their closest phylogenetic neighbors and were considered to merit species status as Streptomyces auratus sp. nov., Streptomyces phaeoluteichromatogenes sp. nov., Streptomyces phaeogriseichromatogenes sp. nov., and Streptomyces phaeoluteigriseus sp. nov., respectively.\n",
      "induction and derepression of arginase and ornithine transaminase in different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. \n",
      "\t The syntheses of arginase and ornithine transaminase were studied in two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, viz. strain B and strain alpha-sigma 1278b. Derepression of both enzymes during nitrogen starvation was shown only by strain B, non-specific induction of arginase only by strain alpha-sigma 1278b. This different response of both strains studied reveals substantial differences in the regulation of enzyme synthesis among yeast strains of one and the same species. The specific enzyme activities observed in chemostat cultures with arginine as the nitrogen source and different sugars, at variable carbon to nitrogen ratios, did not indicate the involvement of carbon catabolite repression in the regulation of arginase and ornithine transaminase syntheses. Specific arginase activities observed in the continuous cultures varied widely and did not show a correlation with the intracellular arginine concentration. Extracellular steady-state arginine concentrations higher than about 1.0 mM, in addition to abundant energy supply, were found to be required for high production of arginase. It is suggested that, besides intracellular arginine, extracellular arginine may provide an induction signal necessary for full-scale induction of arginase synthesis. A possible intermediary role of arginine permeases or of other membrane proteins is discussed.\n",
      "Virulence of Escherichia coli strains isolated from urine of patients with acute cystitis and from faeces of healthy women. \n",
      "\t E. coli strains were isolated from the urine of patients with acute cystitis in general practice and from the faeces of a comparable reference group of healthy individuals. These strains were serotyped and tested for virulence in an experimental mouse model. Of 30 cystitis-strains 18 were virulent, and of 30 faeces-strains 15 were virulent. It is concluded that the cystitis-strains were not more often virulent than the faeces-strains. O antigens commonly found among urinary E. coli isolates were present in 60% of the cystitis-strains and in 37% of the faeces-strains. K antigens commonly found in urinary E. coli strains were present in 33% of the cystitis-strains and in 12% of the faeces-strains. Neither the presence of common urinary O-antigens, nor the presence of common urinary K antigens could be associated with virulence of the isolated strains. However, it is suggested that certain O and K antigens (O2,O6, K23) may be associated with virulence for the urinary tract.\n",
      "Extracellular protein release and its response to pH level in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. \n",
      "\t Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in batch culture at pH 5.5 releases 0.1 to 0.2 pg protein per cell to the external medium over a period of four to five days, final concentration 20-40 micrograms/ml. Cells grown at pH 3.0 release 10-fold this quantity (1-2 pg/cell, final concentration 100-200 micrograms/ml). A kinetic model based on published behavior of periplasmic protein gave a good fit to the observed kinetics of exoprotein yield. The electrophoretic pattern of exoprotein differed from that of cell lysate protein, and exoprotein synthesis was apparently limited to early stages of the life cycle. These results are consistent with the identification of exoprotein as periplasmic protein released to the external medium through the cell wall. Analysis of the observed kinetics of exoprotein yield, utilizing the kinetic model suggests that the greater exoprotein production of cells grown at pH 3.0 was due entirely to greater synthesis of periplasmic proteins while the fraction of periplasmic protein released per unit time was greater for cells grown at pH 5.5. The latter conclusion is supported by thicker cell walls of cells grown at pH 3.0 as observed by electron microscopy. At an applied level the apparent limitation of exoprotein synthesis to the first few hours of cell life, the slow leakage of exoprotein through the cell wall, and the dilute nature of a yeast suspension do not favor the utilization of yeast cells for direct conversion of substrate into protein released to the external medium.\n",

      "\t A total of 633 anaerobic bacteria were examined for tryptophanase production using a rapid method which distinguishes within 5 to 180 minutes between anaerobes that contain tryptophanase and those that do not. Of the 196 tryptophanase-positive isolates tested, 99% showed tryptophanase activity within 2 hours as compared with 94.4% in 24 hours by a conventional method. A total of 299 tryptophanase-negative organisms were tested. Ninety three percent of these remained negative after 24 hours as compared with 95.3% when tested within a 24-h conventional method. Additional information was obtained on the sensitivity of this test and the time-dependent production of indole by tryptophanase.\n",

      "\t A Proteus-typing method based on proticin production and proticin susceptibility (c.f. Senior, 1977) has been modified to increase its sensitivity Proticins were prepared in fluid medium and applied to agar-plates shortly before seeding the plates with indicator bacteria. A given 10 proticin producer strains, which are responsible for the susceptibility patterns of the indicator-bacteria (S-types), form the foundation for this typing method. Using this producer-set and indicator-set (28 strains) was selected which was suitable for the typing of strains with different proticin activities (P-types). Standardization of the temperature for proticin production proved to be necessary. The degree of similarity between proticins was further elaborated by testing all indicator strains for susceptibility to proticin titrations. In the group of 148 clinical Proteus-isolates (four species) used for the development of the typing system 28 S-types and 34 P-types were observed. By combining the S-and P-type parameters 86 S-P-types were obtained for the 4 species combined. Seven strains were not typable. A separate group of 100 clinical Proteus-isolates was tested in order to prove the usefulness of the method. 39 new S-P types were found. Repeated isolations from the same patients yield the same patterns. Proteus S-P-typing is a useful method for the typing of Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis, but proves inadequate for the typing of Proteus rettgeri and Proteus morganii.\n",

      "\t Bacteria, yeasts and fungi suspended in a dextran solution were added to ampoules containing strips of filter paper which were dried without vacuum conditions. The ampoules were sealed and stored in the dark at room temperature. Viability counts were made of the original suspension immediately after drying and after storage periods of 3-48 months. Although bacterial cultures of many general did not show much resistance against dry conditions, bacteria of 13 other general had survived well or moderately after 4 years of storage. Most of the dried yeast cultures had survived after this period. Of the 16 fungal genera tested, species of 6 genera exhibited growth after 4 years.

      "\t The initial rate of D-glucosamine uptake by the non-halotolerant yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was approximately halved as the apparent half saturation constant (Km) and the apparent maximum velocity (Vmax) changed from 6.6 mM to 16.4 mM and from 22 mumol.g-1.min-1 to 16 mumol.g-1.min-1, respectively, when the salinity in the medium was increased from zero M to 0.68 M NaCl. Corresponding changes in a high affinity transport system in the halotolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii were from 1.1 mM to 4.6 mM and from 3.1 mumol.g-1.min-1 to 4.5 mumol.g-1.min-1, implying a practically unchanged transport capacity. In 2.7 M NaCl, Km and Vmax in this system were 24.5 mM and 1.1 mumol.g-1.min-1, respectively, representing a marked decrease in transport capability. Nevertheless, the degree of affinity in this extreme salinity must still be regarded as noteworthy. In addition to the high affinity transport system in D. hansenii, a low affinity system, presumably without relevance in D-glucosamine transport, was observed.\n",

      "\t Esculin hydrolysis is one of the biochemical tests used in the identification of anaerobic microorganisms. The conventional method by use of growing microbial cells requires 24-48 hours of incubation. On the other hand, growth independent methods like the buffered esculin test, the spot test, and the PathoTec strip test utilize the presence of constitutive enzymes and, therefore, yield results in 1-4 hours. A total of 817 anaerobic organisms were used in this study to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the three rapid methods. All three rapid methods gave excellent correlation with the standard conventional method. Over 99% of the organisms gave comparable results with the spot test and the buffered esculin test within one hour; the PathoTec strip test required up to 4 hours. The former two were not only more rapid but also more economical than the PathoTec strip test.\n",

      "\t The properties of an Escherichia coli K-12 mutant are described which seemingly produces a \"new\" major outer membrane protein with an apparent molecular weight of 40 000. This 40K protein was purified and its cyanogen bromide (CNBr) fragments were compared with those of several known major outer membrane proteins. A similarity was found between the CNBr fragments of the 40K protein and those of the OmpF protein (molecular weight 37 000). In addition, the 40K protein was found to be regulated exactly like the OmpF protein, and the mutation which causes the production of the 40K protein has been localized in (or very close to) the ompF gene. It is concluded that the 40K protein is a mutant form of the OmpF protein. The results provide additional evidence that the ompF gene at minute 21 is the structural gene for the OmpF protein.\n",

Although the cross between the type culture of the two species failed to produce viable basidiospores, another pair of isolates did yield viable basidiospores. The segregation of phenotypic markers among the tetrads isolated from this inter specific cross proved that meiosis had occurred. On the basis of other previously known differences and the present genetic study, the two species are now considered to be two varieties of the species, F. neoformans. The anamorph of F. neoformans var. neoformans grew well at 37 degrees C in vitro and produced fatal infection in mice while that of F. neoformans var. bacillispora grew poorly at 37 degree C and failed to produce fatal infection in mice. Cryptococcus bacillisporus Kwon-Chung et Bennett is regarded as a synonym of C. neoformans var. gattii Vanbreuseghem et Takashio.\n",

The incidence of resistance in human strains concurrently decreased from about 80% in 1974 to 25% and 1%, respectively, in 1980. The build-up of multiple resistance in bovine S. dublin and S. typhimurium strains, already started in 1973-74, has continued. Recently, phage type 193 S. typhimurium strains have become predominant and they are invariable resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, sulphonamide and trimethoprim. Up to now, type 193 strains were hardly encountered in human patients, but the number of human isolates is slowly increasing.

Under heterotrophic conditions with fructose or gluconate as substrates neither colony formation on solid medium nor the growth rates in liquid media were drastically impaired by up to 100% oxygen. In contrast, autotrophic growth--with hydrogen, carbon dioxide and up to 80% oxygen in the gas atmosphere--was strongly depressed by high oxygen concentrations. However, only the growth rate, not the viability of the cells, was decreased. Growth retardation was accompanied by a decrease of hydrogenase activity.\n",

      "\t The four temperature-sensitive mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the cell division cycle defective in cytokinesis (cdc, 3, 10, 11 and 12), have been analyzed with respect to the biosynthesis of the cell wall polymers. After 3 hours of incubation at the non-permissive temperature (37 degrees C) these strains stop growing. The synthesis of glucan, mannan and chitin (wall polymers) level off in a similar time, but glucan, mannan and chitin synthases remained active for at least 4 hours. If the mutants are analyzed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy different pictures emerge. Two of the mutants cdc 10 and cdc 12, after 3 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C present apparently normal cytoplasms and cell wall surfaces with multiple elongated buds. The other two mutants, cdc 3 and cdc 11, present a completely disarranged cytoplasmic content and damage at the level of the plasma membrane is evident. These and other observations, suggest that between the execution points of cdc 3 (0.27) and cdc 10 (0.58), essential processes in the assembly of cell membrane occur.\n",

From colony counts resulting from growth on the respective media, the proportion of fused complementary protoplasts (prototrophic colonies) to the total viable number of colony forming units was determined. Stability tests of selected colonies from the minimal and complete agar revealed multiple revertants, but the numbers declined to low frequencies upon repeated selective plating and isolation. Acridine orange staining of cultures thus stabilized revealed various sizes of cells with their numbers of nuclei (DNA-staining regions) varying from one to five, such that it was not determined whether the prototrophic cultures were monokaryons, heterokaryons or a mixture of the two.\n",

A membrane-fusion procedure has been developed by which pmf-generating systems can be functionally incorporated into the bacterial membrane. This improved model system has been used to analyze the properties of amino acid transport systems in lactococci. Detailed studies have been made of the specificity and kinetics of amino acid transport and also of the interaction of the transport systems with their lipid environment. The properties of a pmf-independent, arginine-catabolism specific transport system in lactococci will be discussed.\n",

      "\t Escherichia coli recombinant strains bearing the thr operon have been previously selected for threonine production and phenotypically classified according to antibiotic resistance properties (Nudel et al. 1987). Further analysis of those strains permitted the isolation and restriction mapping of two different plasmids of 13 kb and 18.6 kb. The smaller one, which expressed tetracycline resistance gave better results on threonine accumulation but it was rather unstable when grown without antibiotic pressure. Therefore, other hosts were transformed with those plasmids to improve stability. A threonine-auxotrophic strain was a better host for plasmid maintenance and expression of thr operon. Host influence in plasmid-mediated threonine production was studied in terms of specific yields (the ratios of threonine accumulated to biomass values) and of plasmid maintenance (percent of AprTcr clones after cultivation in non selective media). We also determined that semisynthetic media of defined composition were better than rich media for threonine expression, due to feed-back controls exerted by undesired catabolites accumulated in complex media.\n",

Marked variation occurred in strain prevalence with some strains being represented by single isolates, and the most prevalent by 26 isolates.

      "\t A large number of mycolate actinomycetes have been recovered from deep-sea sediments in the NW Pacific Ocean using selective isolation methods. The isolates were putatively assigned to the genus Rhodococcus on the basis of colony characteristics and mycolic acid profiles. The diversity among these isolates and their relationship to type strains of Rhodococcus and other mycolate taxa were assessed by Curie point pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PyMS). Three major (A, C, D) and two minor (B, E) groups were defined by PyMS. Cluster A was a large group of isolates recovered from sediment in the Izu Bonin Trench (2679 m); Cluster C comprised isolates from both the Izu Bonin Trench (6390 and 6499 m) and from the Japan Trench (4418, 6048 and 6455 m). These Cluster C isolates showed close similarity to Dietzia maris and this was subsequently confirmed using molecular methods. Cluster D contained isolates recovered from a sediment taken from a depth of 1168 m in Sagami Bay and were identified as members of the terrestrial species Rhodococcus luteus. Clusters B and E had close affinities with members of the genera Gordonia and Mycobacterium. The presence of Thermoactinomyces in certain of the deep-sea sediments studied was indicative of the movement of terrestrial material into the ocean depths. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analyses produced excellent definition of most genera of the mycolata, and indicated that the among the deep sea isolates (1) were novel species of Corynebacterium, Gordonia and Mycobacterium, and (2) a Sea of Japan isolate the phylogenetic depth of which suggests the possibility of a new genus. Polyphasic taxonomic analysis revealed considerable diversity among the deep sea rhodococci and evidence for recently diverged species or DNA groups.\n",

      "Cell envelope composition and organisation in the genus Rhodococcus. \n",
      "\t A knowledge of the organisation of the rhodococcal cell envelope is of fundamental importance if the environmental and biotechnological significance of these bacteria are to be understood and successfully exploited. The genus Rhodococcus belongs to a distinctive suprageneric taxon, the mycolata, which includes among others the genera Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium and Nocardia. Members of this taxon exhibit an unusual complexity in their cell envelope composition and organisation compared to other Gram-positive bacteria. Models that describe the architecture of the mycobacterial cell envelope are extrapolated here to provide a model of the rhodococcal cell envelope. The rhodococcal cell envelope is dominated by the presence of an arabinogalactan cell wall polysaccharide and large 2-alkyl 3-hydroxy branched-chain fatty acids, the mycolic acids, which are covalently assembled into a peptidoglycan-arabinogalactan-mycolic acid matrix. This review further emphasises that the mycolic acids in this complex form the basis of an outer lipid permeability barrier. The localisation and roles of other cell envelope components, notably complex free lipids, lipoglycans, proteins and lipoproteins are also considered.\n",
      "Surface-active lipids in rhodococci. \n",
      "\t Like other hydrocarbon-oxidising bacteria, rhodococci respond to the presence of alkanes by producing biosurfactant molecules to improve their ability to utilise these hydrophobic compounds as growth substrates. In the rhodococci these surfactants are predominantly glycolipids, the majority of which remain cell-bound during unrestricted growth. Most work has been done on the trehalose mycolates formed by Rhodococcus erythropolis, but nitrogen-limited conditions lead to the production of anionic trehalose tetraesters also. As surfactants, these compounds, whether purified or in crude form, are able to reduce the surface tension of water from 72 mN m-1 to a low of 26, thus making them among the most potent biosurfactants known. They are also able to reduce the interfacial tension between water and a hydrophobic phase (e.g. n-hexadecane) from 43 mN m-1 to values less than one (Table 1). Biosurfactants have about a ten- to 40-fold lower critical micelle concentration than synthetic surfactants. Such properties suggest a range of industrial applications, where a variety of surface-active characteristics are appropriate. Interest in biosurfactants as industrial chemicals results from the toxicity of many petrochemical-derived surfactants. Currently world-wide surfactant production is on a very large scale, and the demand for them is increasing. However, the drive towards less environmentally damaging chemicals makes biosurfactants attractive as they have lower toxicity. The reason they have not achieved a significant market share is the cost of production, which is considerably higher than for synthetic surfactants. This problem is being addressed using several strategies. An approach where there is great scope for improvement with the rhodococci is an understanding of the genetic basis of glycolipid production, which is largely unknown. They may find applications in the near future in the environmental remediation industries, where the requirement for purified molecules is of less importance. This review summarises knowledge of the chemistry, biochemistry and production of Rhodococcus surface-active lipids. Where they have been used, or there is potential for use, in industrial applications is discussed.\n",

The proteolytic core of this complex, the 20S proteasome, is also ubiquitous in archaea. Although absent from most eubacteria, this multi-subunit protease was recently discovered in Rhodococcus and appears to be confined to actinomycetes. The eubacterial 20S proteasome represents an attractive complementary system to study proteasome assembly, quaternary structure, and catalytic mechanism. In addition, it is likely to contribute substantially to our understanding of the role of various self-compartmentalizing proteases in bacterial cells.\n",
      "The putative regulator of catechol catabolism in Rhodococcus opacus 1CP--an IclR-type, not a LysR-type transcriptional regulator. \n",
      "\t The catechol catabolic genes catABC from Rhodococcus opacus 1CP have previously been characterized by sequence analysis of the insert cloned on plasmid pRER1. Now, a 5.1-kb DNA fragment which overlaps with the insert of pRER1 was cloned, yielding pRER2, and subjected to sequencing. Besides three other open reading frames, a gene was detected ca 200 bp upstream of the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase gene catA, which is obviously transcribed divergently from catABC. The protein which can be deduced from this gene, CatR, resembles members of the PobR subfamily of IclR-type regulatory proteins. This finding was unexpected, as all catechol and chlorocatechol gene clusters known thus far from proteobacteria are under control of LysR-type regulators. It was not possible to inactivate catR by homologous recombination. However, heterologously expressed CatR in vitro bound specifically to the intergenic region between catR and catA thereby providing a first indication for a possible involvement of CatR in the regulation of catechol catabolism.\n",
      "Biotransformation of nitriles by rhodococci. \n",
      "\t Rhodococci have been shown to be capable of a very wide range of biotransformations. Of these, the conversion of nitriles into amides or carboxylic acids has been studied in great detail because of the biotechnological potential of such activities. Initial investigations used relatively simple aliphatic nitriles. These studies were quickly followed by the examination of the regio- and stereoselective properties of the enzymes involved, which has revealed the potential synthetic utility of rhodococcal nitrile biotransforming enzymes. Physiological studies on rhodococci have shown the importance of growth medium design and bioreactor operation for the maximal conversion of nitriles. This in turn has resulted in some truly remarkable biotransformation activities being obtained, which have been successfully exploited for commercial organic syntheses (e.g. acrylamide production from acrylonitrile). The two main types of enzyme involved in nitrile biotransformations by rhodococci are nitrile hydratases (amide synthesis) and nitrilases (carboxylic acid synthesis with no amide intermediate released). It is becoming clear that many rhodococci contain both activities and multiple forms of each enzyme, often induced in a complex way by nitrogen containing molecules. The genes for many nitrile-hydrolysing enzymes have been identified and sequenced. The crystal structure of one nitrile hydratase is now available and has revealed many interesting aspects of the enzyme structure in relationship to its catalytic activity and substrate selectivity.\n",
      "Enantioselective biotransformations using rhodococci. \n",
      "\t The use of enzymes and whole cells in enantioselective biotransformation reactions is briefly reviewed. A Rhodococcus strain is shown to possess nitrile hydratase and amidase activity. The organism can be used for the enantioselective biotransformation of racemic alpha-amino amides to (S) alpha-amino acids with an enantiomeric excess (ee) of > 98%. Enantioselectivity is effectively time independent allowing easy quantitative conversion of racemic mixtures into enantiomerically pure alpha-amino amides and alpha-amino acids. The reaction is effective for a wide range of alpha-substituents. The pH-dependence of the reaction indicates that the alpha-amino amide is bound to the amidase enzyme in its neutral unprotonated form.\n",
      "Application of whole cell rhodococcal biocatalysts in acrylic polymer manufacture. \n",
      "\t Rhodococci are ubiquitous in nature and their ability to metabolise a wide range of chemicals, many of which are toxic, has given rise to an increasing number of studies into their diverse use as biocatalysts. Indeed rhodococci have been shown to be especially good at degrading aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and amides and thus they are very useful for waste clean up where these toxic chemicals are present. The use of biocatalysts in the chemical industry has in the main been for the manufacture of high-value fine chemicals, such as pharmaceutical intermediates, though investigations into the use of nitrile hydratase, amidase and nitrilase to convert acrylonitrile into the higher value products acrylamide and acrylic acid have been carried out for a number of years. Acrylamide and acrylic acid are manufactured by chemical processes in vast tonnages annually and they are used to produce polymers for applications such as superabsorbents, dispersants and flocculants. Rhodococci are chosen for use as biocatalysts on an industrial scale for the production of acrylamide and acrylic acid due to their ease of growth to high biomass yields, high specific enzyme activities obtainable, their EFB class 1 status and robustness of the whole cells within chemical reaction systems. Several isolates belonging to the genus Rhodococcus have been shown in our studies to be among the best candidates for acrylic acid preparation from acrylonitrile due to their stability and tolerance to high concentrations of this reactive and disruptive substrate. A critical part of the selection procedure for the best candidates during the screening programme was high purity product with very low residual substrate concentrations, even in the presence of high product concentrations. Additionally the nitrile and amide substrate scavenging ability which enables rhodococci to survive very successfully in the environment leads to the formation of biocatalysts which are suitable for the removal of low concentrations of acrylonitrile and acrylamide in waste streams and for the removal of impurities in manufacturing processes.\n",
      "Desulphurisation of benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene by actinomycete organisms belonging to the genus Rhodococcus, and related taxa. \n",
      "\t Desulphurising enzymes remove the sulphur moiety from an organosulphur molecule leaving the carbon skeleton intact. Two kinds of desulphurisation reaction are recognised. The dibenzothiophene (DBT)-specific pathway desulphurises DBT to inorganic sulphite and 2-hydroxybiphenyl (HBP), and the benzothiophene (BTH)-specific pathway desulphurises BTH to 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)ethan 1-al (HPEal) and probably inorganic sulphite. The DBT-desulphurisation pathway was originally identified in Rhodococcus erythropolis strain IGTS8 (ATCC 53968), and the BTH-desulphurisation pathway in Gordonia sp. strain 213E (NCIMB 40816). These organisms do not further metabolise the organic product of desulphurisation. In this article current knowledge of the biochemistry and genetics of the desulphurisation enzymes is reviewed. The need for separate, DBT- and BTH-specific desulphurisation routes is rationalised in terms of the chemical differences between the two compounds. The desulphurisation pathway is compared with other microbial DBT-degrading enzyme systems. Finally some comments are made concerning the application of desulphurisation enzymes for fuel desulphurisation and on the relevance of these enzymes to the ecology of the mycolata (sensu Chun et al, 1996).\n",
      "Applied aspects of Rhodococcus genetics. \n",
      "\t Eubacteria of the genus Rhodococcus are a diverse group of microorganisms commonly found in many environmental niches from soils to seawaters and as plant and animal pathogens. They exhibit a remarkable ability to degrade many organic compounds and their economic importance is becoming increasingly apparent. Although their genetic organisation is still far from understood, there have been many advances in recent years. Reviewed here is the current knowledge of rhodococci relating to gene transfer, recombination, plasmid replication and functions, cloning vectors and reporter genes, gene expression and its control, bacteriophages, insertion sequences and genomic rearrangements. Further fundamental studies of Rhodococcus genetics and the application of genetic techniques to the these bacteria will be needed for their continued biotechnological exploitation.\n",
      "Structural alteration of linear plasmids encoding the genes for polychlorinated biphenyl degradation in Rhodococcus strain RHA1. \n",
      "\t Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) tolerant derivatives of a strong PCB degrader, Rhodococcus strain RHA1, were selected after growth in the presence of 100 micrograms/ml PCBs. Some of the derivatives did not grow on biphenyl but accumulated a yellow coloured metabolite suggesting a defect in the meta-ring-cleavage compound hydrolase step encoded by the bphD gene. Other derivatives failed to grow on biphenyl and exhibited little PCB transformation activity suggesting a defect in the initial ring-hydroxylation dioxygenase step encoded by the bphA gene. These organisms had a structural alteration in the linear plasmids coding for the bph genes in RHA1, which included the bph gene deletion. When a bphD containing plasmid was introduced into a tolerant derivative, RCD1, which was shown to have bphD deletion, the defect in the growth on biphenyl of RCD1 was overcome. The bph gene deletion seems to play a key role in these tolerant derivatives thereby suggesting that the toxic metabolic intermediate would be a main cause of the growth inhibition of RHA1 in the presence of high concentration PCBs.\n",
      "Cloning of genes that have environmental and clinical importance from rhodococci and related bacteria. \n",
      "\t Generalised and specialised transduction systems were developed for Rhodococcus by means of bacteriophage Q4. The latter was used in conjunction with DNA from an unstable genetic element of R. rhodochrous to construct resistance plasmids which replicate in strains of R. equi, R. erythropolis and R. rhodochrous. One of the plasmids, pDA21, was joined with Erythropolis coli suicide vector pEcoR251 to obtain shuttle plasmids maintained in both rhodococci and E. coli. Conjugation between these rhodococcal strains demonstrated all were interfertile with each other and that some of the determinants for this were located on the unstable genetic element. Plasmids derived from this element, such as pDA21, carried the conjugative and self-incompatibility capacities; deletion analysis revealed that DNA necessary for self-incompatibility overlapped with that for arsenic resistance. Rifampicin is one of the principal chemotherapeutic agents used to treat infections by rhodococci and related organisms. The genes responsible for two types of inactivation have been cloned. The sequence of the R. equi DNA responsible for decomposition of the antibiotic strongly resembled those of monooxygenases acting upon phenolic compounds, consistent with the presence of a naphthalenyl moiety in the rifampicin molecule. Antibiotic resistance conferred by the gene was surprisingly specific to the semisynthetic compounds rifampicin (150-fold increase) and rifapentine (70-fold). Similar specificity was observed with the other inactivation gene cloned, which ribosylates rifampicin at the 23-hydroxyl position. A 60-bp sequence upstream of the monooxygenase and ribosylation genes is strikingly similar suggesting a shared pattern of regulation. Rhodococcal arsenic resistance and azo dye degradation genes have been cloned and characterised.\n",
      "Molecular characterisation of a Rhodococcus ohp operon. \n",
      "\t The ohp operon of Rhodococcus strain V49 consists of five genes, ohpR, ohpA, ohpB, ohpC and ohpD which encode putative regulator and transport proteins and confirmed monooxygenase, hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase enzymes, respectively. These enzymes catalyse the conversion of 3-(2-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid to the corresponding linear product via a meta-cleavage pathway. Confirmation that the ohp gene cluster formed an operon was provided by gene disruption during which expression of Bacillus levansucrase was confirmed in Rhodococcus. Following biochemical assays of cell-free extracts from recombinant Escherichia coli expressing ohpB (monooxygenase), ohpC (hydroxymuconic-semialdehyde hydrolase) and ohpD (catechol 2,3-dioxygenase), the ortho-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid catabolic pathway in Rhodococcus strain V49 (ATCC 19070) has been predicted.\n",
      "Molecular bases of epithelial cell invasion by Shigella flexneri. \n",
      "\t The pathogenesis of shigellosis is characterized by the capacity of the causative microorganism, Shigella, to invade the epithelial cells that compose the mucosal surface of the colon in humans. The invasive process encompasses several steps which can be summarized as follows: entry of bacteria into epithelial cells involves signalling pathways that elicit a macropinocitic event. Upon contact with the cell surface, S. flexneri activates a Mxi/Spa secretory apparatus encoded by two operons comprising about 25 genes located on a large virulence plasmid of 220 kb. Through this specialized secretory apparatus, Ipa invasins are secreted, two of which (IpaB, 62 kDa and IpaC, 42 kDa) form a complex which is itself able to activate entry via its interaction with the host cell membrane. Interaction of this molecular complex with the cell surface elicits major rearrangements of the host cell cytoskeleton, essentially the polymerization of actin filaments that form bundles supporting the membrane projections which achieve bacterial entry. Active recruitment of the protooncogene pp 60c-src has been demonstrated at the entry site with consequent phosphorylation of cortactin. Also, the small GTPase Rho is controlling the cascade of signals that allows elongation of actin filaments from initial nucleation foci underneath the cell membrane. The regulatory signals involved as well as the proteins recruited indicate that Shigella induces the formation of an adherence plaque at the cell surface in order to achieve entry. Once intracellular, the bacterium lyses its phagocytic vacuole, escapes into the cytoplasm and starts moving the inducing polar, directed polymerization of actin on its surface, due to the expression of IcsA, a 120 kDa outer membrane protein, which is localized at one pole of the microorganism, following cleavage by SopA, a plasmid-encoded surface protease. In the context of polarized epithelial cells, bacteria then reach the intermediate junction and engage their components, particularly the cadherins, to form a protrusion which is actively internalized by the adjacent cell. Bacteria then lyse the two membranes, reach the cytoplasmic compartment again, and resume actin-driven movement.\n",
      "Quorum sensing and the cell-cell communication dependent regulation of gene expression in pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. \n",
      "\t Although it has been clear for some time that individual bacterial cells employ intra-cellular signalling systems to sense, integrate and process information from their surroundings, their widespread capacity to perceive information from other bacterial cells is only just beginning to be recognised. Recent work has established that diverse bacteria exploit a cell-cell communication device to regulate the transcription of multiple target genes. This communication device termed 'quorum sensing', depends on the production of one or more diffusible signal molecules termed 'autoinducers' or 'pheromones' which enable a bacterium to monitor its own cell population density. Quorum sensing is thus an example of multicellular behaviour in prokaryotes and regulates diverse physiological processes including bioluminescence, swarming, antibiotic biosynthesis, plasmid conjugal transfer and the production of virulence determinants in animal, fish and plant pathogens. In Gram-negative bacteria, the best understood family of signal molecules are the N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) which vary predominantly in the presence or absence of an acyl chain C3 substituent (oxo- or hydroxy-) and length of the N-acyl side chain. However not all quorum sensing signal molecules are AHLs; in Gram-positive bacteria, they are often post-translationally modified peptides. Irrespective of the chemical 'language' employed, interference with either the synthesis or transmission of a quorum sensing signal molecule in pathogenic bacteria offers an exciting new strategy for controlling infection.\n",
      "Current topics in signal transduction in bacteria. \n",
      "\t Among the signal transfer systems in bacteria two types predominate: two-component regulatory systems and quorum sensing systems. Both types of system can mediate signal transfer across the bacterial cell envelope; however, the signalling molecule typically is not taken up into the cells in the former type of system, whereas it usually is in the latter. The Two-component systems include the recently described (eukaryotic) phosphorelay systems; quorum sensing systems can be based upon autoinducers of the N-acylated homoserine lactones, and on autoinducers of a peptidic nature. A single bacterial cell contains many signalling modules that primarily operate in parallel. This may give rise to neural-network behaviour. Recently, however, for both types of basic signal transfer modules, it has been demonstrated that they also can be organised in series (i.e. in a hierarchical order). Besides their hierarchical position in the signal transduction network of the cell, the spatial distribution of individual signalling modules may also be an important factor in their efficiency in signal transfer. Many challenges lie hidden in future work to understand these signal transfer processes in more detail. These are discussed here, with emphasis on the mutual interactions between different signal transfer processes. Successful contributions to this work will require rigorous mathematical modelling of the performance of signal transduction components, and -networks, as well as studies on light-sensing signal transduction systems, because of the unsurpassed time resolution obtainable in those latter systems, the opportunity to apply repeated reproducible stimuli, etc. The increased understanding of bacterial behaviour that already has resulted--and may further result--from these studies, can be used to fine-tune the beneficial activities of bacteria and/or more efficiently inhibit their deleterious ones.\n",

      "\t The G + C contents of 25 strains of Dipodascus capitatus, Dipodascus spicifer and Geotrichum clavatum were found to be heterogeneous on basis of derivative graphs of the melting profiles.

Being considered separate taxa on basis of these parameters, D. capitatus, D. spicifer and G. clavatum could be identified by a combination of the key characteristics growth on xylose, cellobiose, salicin and arbutin.\n",

      "\t Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571 was found to excrete moderate amounts of a fluorescent pigment into the culture medium in response to dissolved oxygen tensions below 1.0 kPa. The pigment was identified as coproporphyrin, on the basis of its optical and fluorescence spectra. FixLJ and fixK mutant derivatives of ORS571 were found to excrete 25-fold higher amounts of coproporphyrin under micro-aerobic conditions than the wild type strain. These observations suggest that A. caulinodans switches from an aerobic to an anaerobic coproporphyrinogen oxidase when the dissolved oxygen tension falls below 1.0 kPa and that the fixLJ and fixK genes are involved in the regulation of expression of the anaerobic coproporphyrinogen oxidase.\n",
      "Physiological characterisation of a pyruvate-carboxylase-negative Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant in batch and chemostat cultures. \n",
      "\t A prototrophic pyruvate-carboxylase-negative (Pyc-) mutant was constructed by deleting the PYC1 and PYC2 genes in a CEN.PK strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Its maximum specific growth rate on ethanol was identical to that of the isogenic wild type but it was unable to grow in batch cultures in glucose-ammonia media. Consistent with earlier reports, growth on glucose could be restored by supplying aspartate as a sole nitrogen source. Ethanol could not replace aspartate as a source of oxaloacetate in batch cultures. To investigate whether alleviation of glucose repression allowed expression of alternative pathways for oxaloacetate synthesis, the Pyc- strain and an isogenic wild-type strain were grown in aerobic carbon-limited chemostat cultures at a dilution rate of 0.10 h-1 on mixtures of glucose and ethanol. In such mixed-substrate chemostat cultures of the Pyc- strain, steady-state growth could only be obtained when ethanol contributed 30% or more of the substrate carbon in the feed. Attempts to further decrease the ethanol content of the feed invariably resulted in washout. In Pyc- as well as in wild-type cultures, levels of isocitrate lyase, malate synthase and phospho-enol-pyruvate carboxykinase in cell extracts decreased with a decreasing ethanol content in the feed. Nevertheless, at the lowest ethanol fraction that supported growth of the Pyc- mutant, activities of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes in cell extracts were still sufficient to meet the requirement for C4-compounds in biomass synthesis. This suggests that factors other than glucose repression of alternative routes for oxaloacetate synthesis prevent growth of Pyc- mutants on glucose.\n",

      "\t Black meristematic fungi together with lichens and cyanobacteria dominate the micro-flora of rock surfaces in arid and semi-arid environments of hot and cold deserts. This study shows that rock inhabiting meristematic fungi are extremely tolerant against high temperatures, desiccation and osmotic stress. Their temperature tolerance increases with increasing dehydration of the fungal thallus. Air dried mycelia of black yeasts stand temperatures up to 120 degrees C for at least 0.5 hours. As response to high temperatures multilayered cell walls are developed and trehalose is accumulated whereas the intracellular glycerol regulates the osmotic potential under NaCl stress. Strains from rock in moderate climate (North Germany) show the same tolerance than those isolated from the Mediterranean area. Hortaea werneckii--hitherto only described as agent of human Tinea nigra--is shown to be the most tolerant rock inhabiting species tested. Meristematic fungi cannot be pre-adapted to higher growth temperatures by increased incubation temperatures. Considering the results of this study the justification of the term 'stress' is discussed with regard to rock inhabiting fungi and their natural environment. Consequences for conservation treatments of monuments decayed by meristematic fungi are discussed on the basis of the ecophysiological properties of the fungi.\n",

      "Glutamine: a major player in nitrogen catabolite repression in the yeast Dekkera bruxellensis. \n",
      "\t In the present work we studied the expression of genes from nitrogen central metabolism in the yeast Dekkera bruxellensis and under regulation by the Nitrogen Catabolite Repression mechanism (NCR). These analyses could shed some light on the biological mechanisms involved in the adaptation and survival of this yeast in the sugarcane fermentation process for ethanol production. Nitrogen sources (N-sources) in the form of ammonium, nitrate, glutamate or glutamine were investigated with or without the addition of methionine sulfoximine, which inhibits the activity of the enzyme glutamine synthetase and releases cells from NCR. The results showed that glutamine might act as an intracellular sensor for nitrogen availability in D. bruxellensis, by activating NCR. Gene expression analyses indicated the existence of two different GATA-dependent NCR pathways, identified as glutamine-dependent and glutamine-independent mechanisms. Moreover, nitrate is sensed as a non-preferential N-source and releases NCR to its higher level. After grouping genes according to their regulation pattern, we showed that genes for ammonium assimilation represent a regulon with almost constitutive expression, while permease encoding genes are mostly affected by the nitrogen sensor mechanism. On the other hand, nitrate assimilation genes constitute a regulon that is primarily subjected to induction by nitrate and, to a lesser extent, to a repressive mechanism by preferential N-sources. This observation explains our previous reports showing that nitrate is co-consumed with ammonium, a trait that enables D. bruxellensis cells to scavenge limiting N-sources in the industrial substrate and, therefore, to compete with Saccharomyces cerevisiae in this environment.\n",
      "Rethinking cell-cycle-dependent gene expression in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. \n",
      "\t Three studies of gene expression during the division cycle of Schizosaccharomyces pombe led to the proposal that a large number of genes are expressed at particular times during the S. pombe cell cycle. Yet only a small fraction of genes proposed to be expressed in a cell-cycle-dependent manner are reproducible in all three published studies. In addition to reproducibility problems, questions about expression amplitudes, cell-cycle timing of expression, synchronization artifacts, and the problem with methods for synchronizing cells must be considered. These problems and complications prompt the idea that caution should be used before accepting the conclusion that there are a large number of genes expressed in a cell-cycle-dependent manner in S. pombe.\n",

      "\t The composition of the gut microbiota can vary widely between individual mice of the same batch and thereby affect the resulting outcome in experimental studies. Therefore, an efficient method is needed to equalize the gut microbiota prior to the start of critical experiments. In order to minimize variations in gut microbiota between animals and provide the animals with a Gram-negative flora exposing lipopolysaccharides in the cell-walls, C57BL/6 mice were given a mixture of ampicillin, metronidazole and clindamycin in the drinking water for 3 days and then Escherichia coli for two additional days. Treatment with antibiotics alone or with antibiotics in combination with E. coli was well tolerated by all animals. Body weight and liver weight were not affected, although higher hepatic fat content was found in treated animals (p < 0.05). The diversity of the gut microbiota was strongly reduced in animals treated with antibiotics and antibiotics in combination with E. coli (p < 0.01), without affecting the total amount of bacteria. Cloned and sequenced 16S rRNA genes showed high presence of Enterobacteriaceae and Porphymonadaceae in the treated animals. Analysis with Principal Component Analysis gave a clear separation of the composition in microbiota between different treatment groups. The described treatment efficiently equalized the gut microbiota and provided the animals with a strong abundance of Enterobacteriaceae without changing the total load of bacteria. This is a straightforward, lenient and efficient method of pre-treatment to equalize the gut microbiota of mice as a starting procedure of animal studies. \n",

      "\t Many species of dimorphic basidiomycetes are known only in their asexual phase and typically those pigmented in different hues of red have been classified in the large polyphyletic genus Rhodotorula. These yeasts are ubiquitous and include a few species of some clinical relevance. The phylogenetic distribution of Rhodotorula spans three classes: Microbotryomycetes, Cystobasidiomycetes and Exobasidiomycetes. Here, the presented multi-gene analyses resolved phylogenetic relationships between the second largest group of Rhodotorula and the mycoparasite Cystobasidium fimetarium (Cystobasidiales, Cystobasidiomycetes, Pucciniomycotina). Based on the results, we propose the transfer of nine species belonging to the Rhodotorula minuta clade into the genus Cystobasidium. As a result, the clinically relevant species R. minuta will be renamed Cystobasidium minutum. This proposal follows ongoing reassessments of the anamorphic genus Rhodotorula reducing the polyphyly of this genus. The delimitation of the R. minuta clade from Rhodotorula species comprised in Sporidiobolales including the type species Rhodotorula glutinis is an important step to overcome obsolete generic placements of asexual basidiomycetous yeasts. Our proposal will also help to distinguish most common red yeasts from clinical samples such as members of Sporidiobolales and Cystobasidiales. The diagnosis of the genus Cystobasidium is amended by including additional characteristics known for the related group of species. The taxonomic change enables us to classify two novel species with the phylogenetically related members of the R. minuta clade in Cystobasidium.

      "VeA of Aspergillus niger increases spore dispersing capacity by impacting conidiophore architecture. \n",
      "\t Aspergillus species are highly abundant fungi worldwide. Their conidia are among the most dominant fungal spores in the air. Conidia are formed in chains on the vesicle of the asexual reproductive structure called the conidiophore. Here, it is shown that the velvet protein VeA of Aspergillus niger maximizes the diameter of the vesicle and the spore chain length. The length and width of the conidiophore stalk and vesicle were reduced nearly twofold in a ΔveA strain. The latter implies a fourfold reduced surface area to develop chains of spores. Over and above this, the conidial chain length was approximately fivefold reduced. The calculated 20-fold reduction in formation of conidia by ΔveA fits the 8- to 17-fold decrease in counted spore numbers. Notably, morphology of the ΔveA conidiophores of A. niger was very similar to that of wild-type Aspergillus sydowii. This suggests that VeA is key in conidiophore architecture diversity in the fungal kingdom. The finding that biomass formation of the A. niger ΔveA strain was reduced twofold shows that VeA not only impacts dispersion capacity but also colonization capacity of A. niger. \n",

Both strains were found to be able to grow at 20-50 °C (optimum 30 °C), at 1.7-4.8 M NaCl (optimum 2.6-3.1 M NaCl), at 0-1.0 M MgCl2 (optimum 0.005-0.1 M MgCl2) and at pH 6.0-9.5 (optimum pH 7.0). The major polar lipids were identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester, phosphatidylglycerol sulfate and one major glycolipid chromatographically identical to a sulfated mannosyl glucosyl diether produced by Halorubrum members of the Halobacteriaceae. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the two strains were 99.9 % identical, showing 94.6-98.0 % similarity to those of members of the genus Halorubrum.

      "\t Group A Streptococci (GAS) are involved in a number of life threatening diseases and biofilm formation by these pathogens are considered as an important virulence determinant as it mediates antibiotic resistance among them. In the present study, we have explored the ability of (+)-usnic acid, a lichen secondary metabolite, as an antibiofilm agent against four serotypes of Streptococcus pyogenes causing pharyngitis. Usnic acid inhibited the biofilms of M serotypes M56, st38, M89 efficiently and the biofilm of M74 to a lesser extent. Confocal imaging of the treated samples showed that usnic acid reduced the biomass of the biofilms when compared to that of the control. Fourier Transfer Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy indicated that usnic acid reduced the cellular components (proteins and fatty acids) of the biofilms. Interestingly, the FT-IR spectrum further revealed that usnic acid probably acted upon the fatty acids of the biofilms as evident from the disappearance of a peak at 2,455-2,100 cm(-1) when compared to the control only in serotypes M56, st38 and M89 but not in M74. The present study shows, for the first time, that usnic acid can act as an effective antibiofilm agent against GAS. \n",

      "\t Sulfide-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Beggiatoa are known to accumulate phosphate intracellularly as polyphosphate but little is known about the structure and properties of these inclusions. Application of different staining techniques revealed the presence of unusually large polyphosphate inclusions in the marine Beggiatoa strain 35Flor. The inclusions showed a co-occurrence of polyphosphate, calcium and magnesium when analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Similar to polyphosphate-enriched acidocalcisomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the polyphosphate inclusions in Beggiatoa strain 35Flor are enclosed by a lipid layer and store cations. However, they are not notably acidic. 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic reconstruction showed an affiliation of Beggiatoa strain 35Flor to a monophyletic branch, comprising other narrow vacuolated and non-vacuolated Beggiatoa species. The polyphosphate inclusions represent a new type of membrane surrounded storage compartment within the genus Beggiatoa, distinct from the mostly nitrate-storing vacuoles known from other marine sulfide-oxidizing bacteria of the family Beggiatoaceae.\n",
      "Paenibacillus lentimorbus enhances growth of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) in chromium-amended soil. \n",
      "\t Chromium (Cr), with its great economic importance in industrial use, is a major metal pollutant of the environment. It affects soil microbial activity and soil fertility, resulting in losses in yield of plants. Paenibacillus lentimorbus B-30488(r) (B-30488(r)) tolerated 200 μg ml(-1) of Cr under in vitro conditions and produced the plant growth promoting substance indole acetic acid in the presence of Cr. Our in vitro study indicates enhancement in B-30488(r) biofilm formation by  sodium alginate (SA) and calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) both in absence and presence of supplemented Cr(VI) as compared to unsupplemented control. The plant growth promoting effects caused by the B-30488(r) biofilm in rhizosphere of chickpea under Cr(VI) stress suggests a  phytoprotective role of B-30488(r) biofilm. Our study reflects the multifarious role of strain B-30488(r) and presents it as a potent plant growth promoting and bioremediation agent useful in Cr-contaminated rhizosphere soil, whereby the SA and CaCl(2) induced B-30488(r) biofilm on plant root acts as a shield in preventing the direct access of toxic Cr to plant tissues, thus reducing its uptake in plants.\n",
      "Characterization of role of the toxR gene in the physiology and pathogenicity of Vibrio alginolyticus. \n",
      "\t toxR, a conserved virulence-associated gene in vibrios, is identified in Vibrio alginolyticus ZJ51-O, a pathogenic strain isolated from diseased fish. To reveal the role of ToxR in the pathogenicity of V. alginolyticus, a deletion mutant was constructed by allelic exchange. The mutant showed the same level of growth in trypticase soy broth (TSB) and iron-limiting condition, as the wild type strain. However, deletion of toxR severely reduced resistance against bile salts and the capability of biofilm formation. Outer-membrane protein (OMP) analysis showed that a 37-kD protein was absent and a 43-kD protein was decreased in the mutant. By MS/MS, the two proteins are identified as the homologues of OmpT and OmpN, respectively. These data suggest that ToxR might have enhanced the bile resistance and biofilm formation through modulating the production of OMP without affecting the ability of iron acquisition and the virulence to the fish via injection. These results indicate that ToxR may assist V. alginolyticus to colonize on the surface of the fish intestine which is crucial for the initiation of the infection, though it may not be involved in the proliferation of the bacteria in the host tissue.\n",
      "Phylogenetic and biochemical characterization of the oil-producing yeast Lipomyces starkeyi. \n",
      "\t Lipomyces starkeyi is an oleaginous yeast, and has been classified in four distinct groups, i.e., sensu stricto and custers α, β, and γ. Recently, L. starkeyi clusters α, β, and γ were recognized independent species, Lipomyces mesembrius, Lipomyces doorenjongii, and Lipomyces kockii, respectively. In this study, we investigated phylogenetic relationships within L. starkeyi, including 18 Japanese wild strains, and its related species, based on internal transcribed spacer sequences and evaluated biochemical characters which reflected the phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of Japanese wild strains formed one clade and this clade is more closely related to L. starkeyi s.s. clade including one Japanese wild strain than other clades. Only three Japanese wild strains were genetically distinct from L. starkeyi. Lipomyces mesembrius and L. doorenjongii shared one clade, while L. kockii was genetically distinct from the other three species. Strains in L. starkeyi s.s. clade converted six sugars, D-glucose, D-xylose, L-arabinose, D-galactose, D-mannose, and D-cellobiose to produce high total lipid yields. The Japanese wild strains in subclades B, C, and D converted D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-mannose to produce high total lipid yields. Lipomyces mesembrius was divided into two subclades. Lipomyces mesembrius CBS 7737 converted D-xylose, L-arabinose, D-galactose, and D-cellobiose, while the other L. mesembrius strains did not. Lipomyces doorenjongii converted all the sugars except D-cellobiose. In comparison to L. starkeyi, L. mesembrius, and L. doorenjongii, L. kockii produced higher total lipid yields from D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-mannose. The type of sugar converted depended on the subclade classification elucidated in this study.\n",
      "Purification and partial biochemical characterization of a membrane-bound type II-like α-glucosidase from the yeast morphotype of Sporothrix schenckii. \n",
      "\t The early steps of glycoprotein biosynthesis involve processing of the N-glycan core by endoplasmic reticulum α-glucosidases I and II which sequentially trim the outermost α1,2-linked and the two more internal α1,3-linked glucose units, respectively. We have demonstrated the presence of some components of the enzymic machinery required for glycoprotein synthesis in Sporothrix schenckii, the etiological agent of human and animal sporotrichosis. However, information on this process is still very limited. Here, a distribution analysis of α-glucosidase revealed that 38 and 50% of total enzyme activity were present in a soluble and in a mixed membrane fraction, respectively. From the latter, the enzyme was solubilized, purified to apparent homogeneity and biochemically characterized. Analysis of the enzyme by denaturing electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography revealed molecular masses of 75.4 and 152.7 kDa, respectively, suggesting a homodimeric structure. Purified α-glucosidase cleaved the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-D: -glucopyranoside with high affinity as judged from K(m) and V(max) values of 0.3 μM and 250 nmol of MU/min/mg protein, respectively. Analysis of linkage specificity using a number of glucose α-disaccharides as substrates demonstrated a clear preference of the enzyme for nigerose, an α1,3-linked disaccharide, over other substrates such as kojibiose (α1,2), trehalose (α1,1) and isomaltose (α1,6). Use of selective inhibitors of processing α-glucosidases such as 1-deoxynojirimycin, castanospermine and australine provided further evidence of the possible type of α-glucosidase. Accordingly, 1-deoxynojirimycin, a more specific inhibitor of α-glucosidase II than I, was a stronger inhibitor of hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-D: -glucopyranoside and nigerose than castanospermine, a preferential inhibitor of α-glucosidase I. Inhibition of hydrolysis of kojibiose and maltose by 1-deoxynojirimycin and castanoespermine was significantly lower than that of nigerose. Taken together, these properties are consistent with a type II-like α-glucosidase probably involved in N-glycan processing. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such an activity in a truly dimorphic fungus.\n",
      "Strategies to select yeast starters cultures for production of flavor compounds in cachaça fermentations. \n",
      "\t In this work, we have used classical genetics techniques to find improved starter strains to produce cachaça with superior sensorial quality. Our strategy included the selection of yeast strains resistant to 5,5',5″-trifluor-D: ,L: -leucine (TLF) and cerulenin, since these strains produce higher levels of higher alcohols and esters than parental strains. However, no clear relationship was observed when levels of flavoring compounds were compared with the levels expression of the genes (BAT1, BAT2, ATF2, EEB1 genes) involved with the biosynthesis of flavoring compounds. Furthermore, we determined the stability of phenotypes considered as the best indicators of the quality of the cachaça for a parental strain and its segregants. By applying the principal component analysis, a cluster of segregants, showing a high number of characteristics similar to the parental strain, was recognized. One segregant, that was resistant to TLF and cerulenin, also showed growth stability after six consecutive replications on plates containing high concentrations of sugar and ethanol. \"Cachaça\" produced at laboratory scale using a parental strain and this segregant showed a higher level of flavoring compounds. Both strains predominated in an open fermentative process through seven cycles, as was shown by mitochondrial restriction fragment length polymorphisms analysis. Based on the physical chemical composition of the obtained products, the results demonstrate the usefulness of the developed strategies for the selection of yeast strains to be used as starters in \"cachaça\" production.\n",

      "\t Sourdoughs are complex ecosystems which are widely used to produce baked goods. This study aimed to provide a dynamic description of an industrial French sourdough ecosystem over 10 consecutive days. The sourdough was obtained from a natural fermentation that has been propagated over several years by the traditional backslopping method. The physico-chemical properties (pH, temperature, total titratable acidity) and the diversity of the lactobacilli among the microbiota were analyzed. A culture-dependent approach provided genotypic (REP-PCR) and phenotypic characterizations. The ecosystem showed a cyclic dynamic. The pH ranged from 3.41 to 3.7 and the acidity levels from 13.9 to 22.4 ml NaOH. A stable lactobacilli microbiota was observed in the sourdough over the 10 days. It was composed of four predominant species assigned to Lactobacillus panis, Lactobacillus frumenti, Lactobacillus amylolyticus and Lactobacillus acetotolerans. The phenotypic tests highlighted an acidification function for the Lb. amylolyticus and Lb. acetotolerans populations, whereas the Lb. panis and Lb. frumenti populations seemed more aromatic. Therefore, this natural sourdough was composed of an atypical microbial association.\n",

The aim of this study was to survey for Ceratocystis spp., and their possible insect associates, on eucalypts in Australia and thus to establish a foundation of knowledge regarding these fungi on the continent. Collections were made in three states of Australia from wounds on trees, as well as from nitidulid beetles associated with these wounds. Ceratocystis spp. were identified based on morphology and multigene sequence comparisons. Of the 54 isolates obtained, two previously unknown species of Ceratocystis were found and these are described here as Ceratocystis corymbiicola sp. nov. and Ceratocystis tyalla sp. nov. Furthermore, the distribution of Ceratocystis pirilliformis is expanded to include Eucalyptus spp. in Tasmania.\n",

      "\t Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonize most frequently in the anterior nares of the nose and cause serious infections all over the world. The aim of this study was to determine the nasal carriage rate of S. aureus and MRSA strains in Turkish elementary school children. We also analyzed molecular characterizations of MRSA strains by using pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi locus sequence typing (MLST), staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) typing, and detection of the Panton-valentine leucocidin (PVL) gene. The nasal swabs were obtained from 4,050 children during a 4 month period in Ankara. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing to 1 mug oxacillin and 30 mug cefoxitin was determined by a disk diffusion method. We found that the 1,001 of 4,050 (24.7%) children were colonized with S. aureus. Three S. aureus strains were resistant to oxacillin and cefoxitin. The rate of MRSA among all children was 0.07%. The MRSA strains revealed three different PFGE pattern. All MRSA isolates by harbored the SCCmec type IV element, but not the PVL gene. The two MRSA isolate belonged to sequence type (ST) 30, whereas the other one was a unique type. The results of this study demonstrated that S. aureus nasal carriage rate was consistent with previous studies. However, MRSA carriage rate was low. This study also indicated that the ST30-type IV without PVL gene MRSA clone may be expected to spread in Turkish community.\n",

      "\t The properties of 166 environmental strains belonging to the seven enterococcal species were studied. Enterococci originated mainly from surface- and waste-waters. They were screened for the presence of enterocins, virulence factors, and antibiotic resistance. The presence of different enterocin genes (entA, entB, entP, ent31, entL50AB) was frequently observed in our enterococcal isolates, 109 strains contained at least one enterocin gene. The distribution of enterocin genes varied according to the species, the genes were present mainly in E. hirae and E. faecium. By enterocin spot assay, 10 isolates inhibited the growth of Listeria strains. To evaluate the pathogenic ability of isolates, the distribution of selected virulence genes (cylA, gelE and esp) was investigated, eleven strains were positive in some of these genes, five of them belonged to E. faecalis. Regarding the antibiotic resistance of isolates, only two strains were multiresistant and two strains (E. hirae and E. casseliflavus) were resistant to vancomycin.\n",

      "\t A polygalacturonase from the filamentous fungus Rhizopus oryzae strain sb (NRRL 29086), previously shown to be effective in the retting of flax fibers, was shown by the analysis of its reaction products on polygalacturonic acid to be an endo-type. By zymogram analysis, the enzyme in the crude culture filtrate appeared as two active species of 37 and 40 kD. The endopolygalacturonase-encoding gene was cloned in Escherichia coli and its translated 383-amino acid sequence found to be identical to that of a presumed exopolygalacturonase found in R. oryzae strain YM9901 and 96% identical to a hypothetical protein (RO3G_04731.1) in the sequenced genome of R. oryzae strain 99-880. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of an unique cluster of Rhizopus polygalacturonase sequences that are separate from other fungal polygalacturonases. Conservation of 12 cysteines appears to be a special feature of this family of Rhizopus polygalacturonase sequences.\n",

The 4th edition of Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (1934) described 132 genera and 2,703 species. The numbers of genera and species with names with standing in the nomenclature in August 2013 were 2,390 and 11,482, respectively, including no more than 75 genera and 250 species that were recognized in 1934. In the years 2006-2012, on average 624 new species were added annually, most of which were described by scientists in Asian countries. We review the past and current species concept for the prokaryotes and the current requirements for the description of new species, based on a 'polyphasic' approach. We discuss the impact of genomics and metagenomics and other new trends toward revitalization of prokaryote systematics, and provide some ideas and speculations on possible future developments in the field. \n",

This strain exhibited potent broad spectrum antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus species and several other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Strain CN-207(T) developed greyish aerial mycelium and pale grey substrate mycelium on yeast extract/malt agar. The isolate produced branching vegetative mycelia with sporangiophores bearing sporangia developing at a late stage of growth. The sporangia contained smooth, non-motile spores. Chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain CN-207(T) were typical of the Streptomyces genus. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain CN-207(T) belonged to the genus Streptomyces, and was most closely related to Streptomyces griseoincarnatus DSM 40274(T), Streptomyces variabilis DSM 40179(T), Streptomyces labedae DSM 41446(T) and Streptomyces erythrogriseus DSM 40116(T). Low DNA-DNA relatedness values were recorded between strain CN-207(T) and its closest phylogenetic neighbours. Strain CN-207(T) was also distinguished from the nearest phylogenetic neighbours using a combination of morphological and phenotypic characteristics. On the basis of its phenotypic and molecular properties, strain CN-207(T) is considered as a novel species of the Streptomyces genus, for which the name Streptomyces tunisiensis sp. nov. is proposed.

      "Diverse bacteria isolated from microtherm oil-production water. \n",
      "\t In total, 435 pure bacterial strains were isolated from microtherm oil-production water from the Karamay Oilfield, Xinjiang, China, by using four media: oil-production water medium (Cai medium), oil-production water supplemented with mineral salt medium (CW medium), oil-production water supplemented with yeast extract medium (CY medium), and blood agar medium (X medium). The bacterial isolates were affiliated with 61 phylogenetic groups that belong to 32 genera in the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Except for the Rhizobium, Dietzia, and Pseudomonas strains that were isolated using all the four media, using different media led to the isolation of bacteria with different functions. Similarly, nonheme diiron alkane monooxygenase genes (alkB/alkM) also clustered according to the isolation medium. Among the bacterial strains, more than 24 % of the isolates could use n-hexadecane as the sole carbon source for growth. For the first time, the alkane-degrading ability and alkB/alkM were detected in Rhizobium, Rhodobacter, Trichococcus, Micrococcus, Enterococcus, and Bavariicoccus strains, and the alkM gene was detected in Firmicutes strains.\n",

The mature spore wall consisted of a broad light inner layer and a thinner dark outer layer including warts. An equatorial ledge was present. During germination in the ascus, a new light inner layer was formed and the old layers of the spore wall partly broke up.

      "\t A tobacco-specific nitrosamine (TSNA), N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), is a potent carcinogen present in cigarette smoke, and chronic exposure to it can lead to pulmonary cancer. NNN causes changes in phospholipid metabolism and the mechanism is yet to be elucidated. Exposure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to 50 μM NNN leads to a substantial decrease in phosphatidylserine (PS) by 63%, phosphatidylcholine (PC) by 42% and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by 36% with a concomitant increase in lysophospholipids (LPL) by 25%. The alteration in phospholipid content was dependent on increasing NNN concentration. Reduced phospholipids were accompanied with increased neutral lipid content. Here we report for the first time that NNN exposure, significantly increases phospholipase B (PLB) activity and the preferred substrate is PC, a major phospholipid responsible for a series of metabolic functions. Furthermore, NNN also promotes the alteration of fatty acid (FA) composition; it increases the long chain fatty acid (C18 series) in phospholipids specifically phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and PS; while on the contrary it increases short chain fatty acids in cardiolipin (CL). NNN mediated degradation of phospholipids is associated with enhanced PLB activity and alteration of phospholipid composition is accompanied with acyl chain remodelling. Understanding the altered phospholipid metabolism produced by NNN exposure is a worthwhile pursuit because it will help to understand the toxicity of tobacco smoke.\n",

The life-span of a zygote was very similar to the life-span of its shorter-lived parent. If one of the parent cells had budded several times prior to fusion, the life-span of the zygote was reduced correspondingly, i.e. there was no 'rescue by hybridization.' In four crosses the distribution of buds on both of the parent cells was recorded. In three of these four crosses the buds were evenly distributed, and in one the alpha-parent had three times as many buds as the a-parent.\n",

We identified sequences homologous to eukaryotic serine/threonine kinases (STKs) and E2-ubiquitin conjugating enzymes in the two Planctomycetes species. To extend these analyses to the Planctomycetes/Verrucomicrobia/Chlamydia super-phylum, we performed comparative analyses using domains from kinases, phosphatases and GTPases that serve as signaling signatures, and we analyzed their distributions. We found substantial differences in kinome densities with regards to other prokaryote clades and among the groups in the Planctomycetes/Verrucomicrobia/Chlamydia super-phylum. In addition, we identified the presence of classic eukaryotic E2-conjugating ubiquitin proteins in prokaryotes, these having previously believed to exist only in eukaryotes.

Anammox bacteria are also important in nature where they contribute significantly to oceanic nitrogen loss. Further, anammox bacteria have similarities to both Archaea and Eukarya, making them extremely interesting from a cell biological perspective. The anammox cell does not conform to the typical prokaryotic cell plan: single bilayer membranes divide the anammox cell into three distinct cellular compartments that possibly also have distinct cellular functions. The innermost and largest compartment, the anammoxosome, is the location of the energy metabolism. The middle compartment, the riboplasm, contains the nucleoid and ribosomes and thus has a genetic, information processing function. Finally, the outermost compartment, the paryphoplasm, has an as yet unknown function. In addition, anammox bacteria are proposed to have an atypical cell wall devoid of both peptidoglycan and a typical outer membrane.

The bacterium forms aggregates with a variable number of cells that are stacked by fibrillar glycoproteic material, the holdfast. A tuft of numerous short glycoproteic fimbriae emerges from one pole of the cell. Preeminent granular inclusions, also of glycoproteic nature, are present in the cytoplasm. Several structural and compositional aspects of the cell envelope and cytoplasm are provided. The production of fibrillar material and the existence of the polar appendages suggest that this microorganism should occur in aquatic environments bound to substrates and could be associated with P. micans in natural marine habitats. Based on the characteristics displayed, this microorganism is a member of the Planctomycetes, order Planctomycetales. \n",

In the presence of 0.1 mM cadmium, 12S was able to completely utilize up to 1.5 mM of phenol as the sole carbon and energy source in an MSM-TRIS medium. Degradation of phenol was accompanied by a slow bacterial growth rate and an extension of the lag phase. The cells grown on phenol showed catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) activity. The activity of C23O from 12S cultivated in medium with Cd(2+) was almost 20 % higher than in the control. Since environmental contamination with aromatic compounds is often accompanied by the presence of heavy metals, Variovorax sp. 12S and its C23O appear to be very powerful and useful tools in the biotreatment of wastewaters and soil decontamination. \n",

Clone libraries were screened by restriction fragment length polymorphism and representative clones from O. somaliensis (100 out of 330 clones), Odontotermes sp. (100 out of 359 clones) and Microtermes sp. (96 out 336 clones) were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated seven bacterial phyla were represented: Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Synergistetes, Planctomycetes and Actinobacteria. Sequences representing the phylum Bacteroidetes (>60 %) were the most abundant group in Odontotermes while those of Spirochaetes (29 %) and Firmicutes (23 %) were the abundant groups in Microtermes. The gut bacterial community structure within the two Odontotermes species investigated here was almost identical at the phylum level, but the Microtermes sp. had a unique bacterial community structure. Bacterial diversity was higher in Odontotermes than in Microtermes. The affiliation and clustering of the sequences, often with those from other termites' guts, indicate a majority of the gut bacteria are autochthonous having mutualistic relationships with their hosts. The findings underscore the presence of termite-specific bacterial lineages, the majority of which are still uncultured. \n",

      "\t Members of the Chlamydiales order all share a biphasic lifecycle alternating between small infectious particles, the elementary bodies (EBs) and larger intracellular forms able to replicate, the reticulate bodies. Whereas the classical Chlamydia usually harbours round-shaped EBs, some members of the Chlamydia-related families display crescent and star-shaped morphologies by electron microscopy. To determine the impact of fixative methods on the shape of the bacterial cells, different buffer and fixative combinations were tested on purified EBs of Criblamydia sequanensis, Estrella lausannensis, Parachlamydia acanthamoebae, and Waddlia chondrophila. A linear discriminant analysis was performed on particle metrics extracted from electron microscopy images to recognize crescent, round, star and intermediary forms. Depending on the buffer and fixatives used, a mixture of alternative shapes were observed in varying proportions with stars and crescents being more frequent in C. sequanensis and P. acanthamoebae, respectively. No tested buffer and chemical fixative preserved ideally the round shape of a majority of bacteria and other methods such as deep-freezing and cryofixation should be applied. Although crescent and star shapes could represent a fixation artifact, they certainly point towards a diverse composition and organization of membrane proteins or intracellular structures rather than being a distinct developmental stage. \n",

      "\t A number of acriflavine-induced mutants of Candida albicans, characterized by their inability to grow on acetate as a source of energy, were screened for their cytochrome absorption spectra. Three mutants with different spectra, along with their parent, were selected for comparative studies of their growth, respiratory activities and cellular structure. The spectrum of one of the mutants was the same as that of the wild-type, but the growth rate and yield of cells on glucose medium were only about 60% of the wild-type's; those of a second mutant deficient in cytochromes aa3 were 50%, and those of a third mutant deficient in cytochromes aa3 and b were less than 5% of those of the wild-type. The cytochrome-complete mutant and the wild-type showed respiratory activity both on glucose and ethanol well above the endogenous, the cytochrome aa3-deficient mutant showed only endogenous respiration, and the cytochrome aa3, b-deficient mutant no respiration at all. Electron microscopy of the wild-type cells revealed discrete, regular ovoidal, cristate mitochondria spaced near the periphery of the protoplasm; the cytochrome-complete mutant showed an abundance of large, cristate, but morphologically irregular mitochondria; the cytochrome aa3-deficient mutant had fewer but still large, cristate, somewhat irregular mitochondria; and the cytochrome aa3, b-deficient mutant only a few simple vesicles without discernible cristae.\n",
      "Biochemical and molecular characterization of Cronobacter spp. (formerly Enterobacter sakazakii) isolated from foods. \n",
      "\t The aim of this study was to identify and characterize Cronobacter spp. isolated from a range of foods. A total of 71 Cronobacter strains were isolated from 602 foods in our laboratory. The highest contamination was observed in foods of plant origin, e.g. spices, teas, chocolate, nuts, pastries and vegetables. On the basis of genus and species identification performed using genus-specific PCR, 16S rRNA sequencing and AFLP genotyping, most of the strains belonged to Cronobacter sakazakii. Biochemical profiling by the tests included in API 20E, complemented with relevant additional tests, classified the strains into 13 biogroups. AFLP genotyping facilitated discrimination of six main groups at the 70% similarity level and strain grouping correlated clearly with species identification. Our results indicate that molecular typing by AFLP may be applied as a useful tool not only for direct comparison of Cronobacter isolates, providing traceability, but also for the reliable species classification. Moreover, tracing of these bacteria in a wider variety of foods should be important to enhance the knowledge of their transmission.\n",

      "Methodological constraints in the molecular biodiversity study of a thermomineral spring cyanobacterial mat: a case study. \n",
      "\t The biodiversity of a specific cyanobacterial mat associated to a thermomineral spring from the Western Plain of Romania was investigated. Light and electron microscopy, together with molecular tools (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis-DGGE, automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis-ARISA and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis-ARDRA), based on 16S rDNA and 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer markers were used. Based on the partial 16S rRNA fragments sequenced, eight cyanobacterial taxons were identified, all belonging to the Oscillatoriales order, Phormidium and Leptolyngbya being dominant. A significant difference was observed, in comparison with the morphological approach. In certain conditions, DGGE can provide misleading information due to multiple melting domains in the same sequence, to multiple rrn operons in the same genome and due to unspecific hybridization among closely related sequences. This can lead to an overestimated species abundance which can cause incorrect description of the microbial community investigated. Additional techniques, such as ARISA and ARDRA, can improve the microbial biodiversity studies, thus providing optimal results.\n",

      "Characterization of lipoteichoic acid structures from three probiotic Bacillus strains: involvement of D-alanine in their biological activity. \n",
      "\t Probiotics represent a potential strategy to influence the host's immune system thereby modulating immune response. Lipoteichoic Acid (LTA) is a major immune-stimulating component of Gram-positive cell envelopes. This amphiphilic polymer, anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane by means of its glycolipid component, typically consists of a poly (glycerol-phosphate) chain with D-alanine and/or glycosyl substitutions. LTA is known to stimulate macrophages in vitro, leading to secretion of inflammatory mediators such as Nitric Oxide (NO). This study investigates the structure-activity relationship of purified LTA from three probiotic Bacillus strains (Bacillus cereus CH, Bacillus subtilis CU1 and Bacillus clausii O/C). LTAs were extracted from bacterial cultures and purified. Chemical modification by means of hydrolysis at pH 8.5 was performed to remove D-alanine. The molecular structure of native and modified LTAs was determined by (1)H NMR and GC-MS, and their inflammatory potential investigated by measuring NO production by RAW 264.7 macrophages. Structural analysis revealed several differences between the newly characterized LTAs, mainly relating to their D-alanylation rates and poly (glycerol-phosphate) chain length. We observed induction of NO production by LTAs from B. subtilis and B. clausii, whereas weaker NO production was observed with B. cereus. LTA dealanylation abrogated NO production independently of the glycolipid component, suggesting that immunomodulatory potential depends on D-alanine substitutions. D-alanine may control the spatial configuration of LTAs and their recognition by cell receptors. Knowledge of molecular mechanisms behind the immunomodulatory abilities of probiotics is essential to optimize their use. \n",

      "\t The aim of this study was to analyze the cell envelope components and surface properties of two phenotypes of Lactobacillus rhamnosus isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract. The ability of the bacteria to adhere to human intestinal cells and to aggregate with other bacteria was determined. L. rhamnosus strains E/N and PEN differed with regard to the presence of exopolysaccharides (EPS) and specific surface proteins. Transmission electron microscopy showed differences in the structure of the outer cell surface of the strains tested. Bacterial surface properties were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, fatty acid methyl esters and hydrophobicity assays. Aggregation capacity and adhesion of the tested strains to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29 was determined. The results indicated a high adhesion and aggregation ability of L. rhamnosus PEN, which possessed specific surface proteins, had a unique fatty acid content, and did not synthesize EPS. Adherence of L. rhamnosus was dependent on specific interactions and was promoted by surface proteins (42-114 kDa) and specific fatty acids. Polysaccharides likely hindered bacterial adhesion and aggregation by masking protein receptors. This study provides information on the cell envelope constituents of lactobacilli that influence bacterial aggregation and adhesion to intestinal cells. This knowledge will help to understand better their specific contribution in commensal-host interactions and adaptation to this ecological niche.\n",

      "\t Radula marginata and Cannabis sativa L. are two phylogenetically unrelated plant species containing structurally similar secondary metabolites like cannabinoids. The major objective of our work was the isolation, identification, biocontrol efficacies, biofilm forming potential and anti-biofilm ability of endophytic microbial community of the liverwort R. marginata, as compared to bacterial endophytic isolates harbored in C. sativa plants. A total of 15 endophytic fungal and 4 endophytic bacterial isolates were identified, including the presence of a bacterial endosymbiont within an endophytic fungal isolate. The endosymbiont was visible only when the fungus containing it was challenged with two phytopathogens Botrytis cinerea and Trichothecium roseum, highlighting a tripartite microbe-microbe interaction and biocontrol potency of endophytes under biotic stress. We also observed sixteen types of endophytic fungal-pathogen and twelve types of endophytic bacterial-pathogen interactions coupled to varying degree of growth inhibitions of either the pathogen or endophyte or both. This showed the magnitude of biocontrol efficacies of endophytes in aiding plant fitness benefits under different media (environmental) conditions. Additionally, it was ecologically noteworthy to find the presence of similar endophytic bacterial genera in both Radula and Cannabis plants, which exhibited similar functional traits like biofilm formation and general anti-biofilm activities. Thus far, our work underlines the biocontrol potency and defensive functional traits (in terms of antagonism and biofilm formation) of endophytes harbored in liverwort R. marginata as compared to the endophytic community of phylogenetically unrelated but phytochemically similar plant C. sativa. \n",

      "\t Staphylococcus equorum, the predominant bacterial species detected in Saeu-jeotgal, a Korean high-salt fermented seafood, is a candidate starter bacterium for Saeu-jeotgal fermentation. A multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme was developed to evaluate the genetic diversity and background of S. equorum strains isolated from Saeu-jeotgal. A total of 135 strains, including 117 isolates from Saeu-jeotgal, and others from Myeolchi-jeotgal, sausage, cheese and horse skin, were subjected to MLST, and the internal fragments of seven housekeeping genes, aroE, dnaJ, glpF, gmk, hsp60, mutS, and pta, were compared. This MLST scheme produced 45 sequence types (STs) and the eBURST algorithm clustered the STs into nine clonal groups and seven singletons. Clonal group 1, the major group, consisted of 30 isolates from cheese, Saeu-jeotgal and sausages, which were classified into 12 STs. The predominant ST, ST26, comprised 25 isolates and presented as a singleton. Most of the isolates from Myeolchi-jeotgal and sausages clustered on two different branches of a phylogenetic tree generated with a cluster analysis using the maximum likelihood algorithm. This MLST scheme established the genetic backgrounds of S. equorum strains isolated from different types of food. Among the housekeeping genes used for MLST, gmk had the fewest allele types and fairly low sequence identities (74.0-90.0%) within the Staphylococcus species. Therefore, sequence analyses of the gmk gene and 16S rRNA gene can be used for the accurate and rapid identification of S. equorum.\n",

      "\t Over the past decade, new culture methods coupled to genome and metagenome sequencing have enabled the number of isolated bacterial species with standing in nomenclature to rise to more than 15,000 whereas it was only 1791 in 1980. 'Culturomics', a new approach based on the diversification of culture conditions, has enabled the isolation of more than 1000 distinct human-associated bacterial species since 2012, including 247 new species. This strategy was demonstrated to be complementary to metagenome sequencing for the exhaustive study of the human microbiota and its roles in health and diseases. However, by identifying a large number of new bacterial species in a short time, culturomics has highlighted a need for taxonomic approaches adapted to clinical microbiology that would include the use of modern and reproducible tools, including high throughput genomic and proteomic analyses. Herein, we review the development of culturomics and genomics in the clinical microbiology field and their impact on bacterial taxonomy.\n",
      "Practically delineating bacterial species with genealogical concordance. \n",
      "\t Bacterial species are commonly defined by applying a set of predetermined criteria, including DNA-DNA hybridization values, 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, phenotypic data as well as genome-based criteria such as average nucleotide identity or digital DNA-DNA hybridization. These criteria mostly allow for the delimitation of taxa that resemble typical bacterial species. Their application is often complicated when the objective is to delineate new species that are characterized by significant population-level diversity or recent speciation. However, we believe that these complexities and limitations can be easily circumvented by recognizing that bacterial species represent unique and exclusive assemblages of diversity. Within such a framework, methods that account for the population processes involved in species evolution are used to infer species boundaries. A method such as genealogical concordance analysis is well suited to delineate a putative species. The existence of the new taxon is then interrogated using an array of traditional and genome-based characters. By making use of taxa in the genera Pantoea, Paraburkholderia and Escherichia we demonstrate in a step-wise process how genealogical concordance can be used to delimit a bacterial species. Genetic, phenotypic and biological criteria were used to provide independent lines of evidence for the existence of that taxon. Our six-step approach to species recognition is straightforward and applicable to bacterial species especially in the post-genomic era, with increased availability of whole genome sequences. In fact, our results indicated that a combined genome-based comparative and evolutionary approach would be the preferred alternative for delineating coherent bacterial taxa.\n",

      "\t Intestinal flora changes were found in patients and animals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, few studies have provided any explicit clues of changes in highly disease related commensal microbiota before disease onset and their relationships with disordered peripheral immune cells. We conducted 16S rRNA microbiota analysis of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice from weaning to diabetes onset to identify highly disease related microbes and performed Spearman correlation analysis between anomalous flora and peripheral immune cells. We found NOD mice had increased exclusive bacteria and decreased community richness or diversity, besides, with the features of decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes and increased abundance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria or Deferribacteres and remarkable fluctuations of genus relative abundance. Furthermore, kinds of highly T1D related genus and their strong correlations with peripheral immune cells, especially neutrophils, were discovered. Microbial changes in NOD mice differed from that of ICR mice and highly disease associated microbes have strong correlations with the peripheral neutrophil ratio, which provide evidence that neutrophils are possibly involved in the pathogenesis of T1D.\n",

It performs crucial functions such as increasing the uptake of nutrients for plant development and preventing plant against plant pathogens. Keeping in mind the beneficial role performed by rhizospheric microorganisms, rhizobacterial species were isolated from the maize and soybean plant's rhizosphere. The isolated microorganisms were evaluated for their biochemical characteristics, plant growth-promoting potentials, tolerance to different environmental conditions, and their antifungal activity against Fusarium graminearum, a fungal pathogen that infects maize. The rhizobacterial isolates with multiple plant growth-promoting potentials were identified as Bacillus spp (80.77%), Rhodocyclaceae bacterium (3.85%), Enterococcus spp (3.85%). Massilia spp (3.85%. and Pseudomonas (7.69%) species based on their 16S rRNA molecular characterization. The bacterial isolates possessed antifungal activities against Fusarium graminearum, promote maize and soybeans seed under laboratory conditions, and exhibited different levels of tolerance to pH, temperature, salt, and heavy metal.

Both effectors brought about similar time-dependent increases in the rate of synthesis and deposition of the cell wall polysaccharides chitin, glucan and mannan. These changes in cell wall composition were accompanied by an increase in the specific activities of glucan and chitin synthetases. This increase was inhibited by cycloheximide suggesting that it represented de novo enzyme biosynthesis and not enzyme activation. Our data are consistent with the notion that both alpha-factor and the cdc 28 mutation affect the same stage-specific function that controls the temporal expression of glycosyl transferases.\n",

Cultivation-dependent methods were focused on putative N(2)-fixers and heterotrophic aerobic bacteria, in the two media tested the values obtained for dry season samples grouped together regardless of the sample type (rhizospheric or non-rhizospheric), these groups also included the non-rhizospheric sample for rainy season, on each medium. These CFU values were smaller and significantly different from those obtained on rhizospheric samples from rainy season. Genera composition among isolates of the rhizospheric samples was very similar for each season, the most abundant taxa being α-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Interestingly, the genus Ochrobactrum was highly represented among rhizospheric samples, when cultured in N-free medium. The structure of the bacterial communities was approached with molecular techniques targeting partial 16S rRNA sequences such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and serial analysis of ribosomal sequence tags. Under these approaches, the most represented bacterial phyla were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. The first two were also highly represented when using isolation techniques.\n",

      "\t Acinetobacter baumannii harbours a gene cluster similar to the iac locus of Pseudomonas putida 1290, which can catabolize the plant hormone indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) as an energy source. However, there has been no evidence showing that IAA can be utilized by A. baumannii. This study showed that A. baumannii can grow in M9 minimal medium containing IAA as the sole carbon source. A mutagenesis study indicated that iacA, encoded in the iac locus of A. baumannii, is involved in the catabolism of IAA. As shown by western blotting analysis, the IacA protein was detected in A. baumannii grown in M9 minimal medium with IAA but not with pyruvate, suggesting that the expression of iacA is regulated by the presence of IAA. In vitro studies have shown that IacA can oxidize indole, an IAA-like molecule, converting it to indoxyl, which spontaneously dimerises to form indigo. In this study, we show that the crude extracts from either wild-type A. baumannii or Escherichia coli overexpressing IacA can oxidize IAA. These results imply that the iac gene cluster of A. baumannii is involved in IAA degradation and that the iacA gene is upregulated when cells encounter IAA in their native environments.\n",

The gyrB based phylogeny mostly confirmed the conventional 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny and thus provides additional support for certain of these 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic groupings. Although pairwise gyrB sequence similarity cannot be used to predict the DNA relatedness between type strains, the gyrB genetic distance can be used as a means to assess quickly whether an isolate is likely to represent a new species in the genus Amycolatopsis. In particular a genetic distance of >0.02 between two Amycolatopsis strains (based on a 315 bp variable region of the gyrB gene) is proposed to provide a good indication that they belong to different species (and that polyphasic taxonomic characterization of the unknown strain is worth undertaking).\n",

      "Cupriavidus metallidurans: evolution of a metal-resistant bacterium. \n",
      "\t Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 has gained increasing interest as a model organism for heavy metal detoxification and for biotechnological purposes. Resistance of this bacterium to transition metal cations is predominantly based on metal resistance determinants that contain genes for RND (resistance, nodulation, and cell division protein family) proteins. These are part of transenvelope protein complexes, which seem to detoxify the periplasm by export of toxic metal cations from the periplasm to the outside. Strain CH34 contains 12 predicted RND proteins belonging to a protein family of heavy metal exporters. Together with many efflux systems that detoxify the cytoplasm, regulators and possible metal-binding proteins, RND proteins mediate an efficient defense against transition metal cations. To shed some light into the origin of genes encoding these proteins, the genomes of C. metallidurans CH34 and six related proteobacteria were investigated for occurrence of orthologous and paralogous proteins involved in metal resistance. Strain CH34 was not much different from the other six bacteria when the total content of transport proteins was compared but CH34 had significantly more putative transition metal transport systems than the other bacteria. The genes for these systems are located on its chromosome 2 but especially on plasmids pMOL28 and pMOL30. Cobalt-nickel and chromate resistance determinants located on plasmid pMOL28 evolved by gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer events, leading to a better adaptation of strain CH34 to serpentine-like soils. The czc cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance determinant, located on plasmid pMOL30 in addition copper, lead and mercury resistance determinants, arose by duplication of a czcICAB core determinant on chromosome 2, plus addition of the czcN gene upstream and the genes czcD, czcRS, czcE downstream of czcICBA. C. metallidurans apparently evolved metal resistance by horizontal acquisition and by duplication of genes for transition metal efflux, mostly on the two plasmids, and decreased the number of uptake systems for those metals.\n",

Here we show that production of the pigmented antibiotics actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin is strongly enhanced in sihf null mutants, while sporulation was strongly inhibited, with an on average 25% increase in spore size. Furthermore, the sihf mutant spores showed strongly reduced viability, with high sensitivity to heat and live/dead staining revealing a high proportion of empty spores, while enhanced expression of sIHF increased viability. This suggests a major role for sIHF in controlling viability, perhaps via the control of DNA replication and/or segregation. Proteomic analysis of the sihf null mutant identified several differentially expressed transcriptional regulators, indicating that sIHF may have an extensive response regulon. These data surprisingly reveal that a basic architectural element conserved in many actinobacteria such as mycobacteria, corynebacteria, streptomycetes and rhodococci may act as a global regulator of secondary metabolism and cell development.\n",
      "Compositions of microbial communities associated with oil and water in a mesothermic oil field. \n",
      "\t Samples of produced water and oil obtained from the Enermark field (near Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada) were separated into oil and aqueous phases first gravitationally and then through centrifugation at 20°C in an atmosphere of 90% N(2) and 10% CO(2). Biomass that remained associated with oil after gravitational separation (1×g) was dislodged by centrifugation at 25,000×g. DNA was isolated from the aqueous and oil-associated biomass fractions and subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification with primers targeting bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes. DNA pyrosequencing and bioinformatics tools were used to characterize the resulting 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The oil-associated microbial community was less diverse than that of the aqueous phase and had consistently higher representation of hydrogenotrophs (methanogens of the genera Methanolobus and Methanobacterium and acetogens of the genus Acetobacterium), indicating the oil phase to be a primary source of hydrogen. Many known hydrocarbon degraders were also found to be oil-attached, e.g. representatives of the gammaproteobacterial genus Thalassolituus, the actinobacterial genus Rhodococcus and the alphaproteobacterial genera Sphingomonas, Brevundimonas and Stappia. In contrast, all eight representatives of genera of the Deltaproteobacteria identified were found to be associated with the aqueous phase, likely because their preferred growth substrates are mostly water-soluble. Hence, oil attachment was seen for genera acting on substrates found primarily in the oil phase.\n",
      "Isolation and characterization of culturable endophytic actinobacteria associated with Artemisia annua L. \n",
      "\t Endophytic actinobacteria isolated from Artemisia annua were characterized and evaluated for their bioactivities. A total of 228 isolates representing at least 19 different genera of actinobacteria were obtained and several of them seemed to be novel taxa. An evaluation of antimicrobial activity showed that more isolates possessed activity towards plant pathogens than activity against other pathogenic bacteria or yeasts. High frequencies of PCR amplification were obtained for type I polyketide synthases (PKS-I, 21.1%), type II polyketide synthases (PKS-II, 45.2%) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS, 32.5%). The results of herbicidal activity screening indicated that 19 out of 117 samples of fermentation broths completely inhibited the germination of Echinochloa crusgalli. This study indicated that endophytic actinobacteria associated with A. annua are abundant and have potentially beneficial and diverse bioactivities which should be pursued for their biotechnical promise.\n",
      "Survival and biofilm formation by Group B streptococci in simulated vaginal fluid at different pHs. \n",
      "\t The Group B Streptococcus (GBS, Streptococcus agalactiae) is an important cause of neonatal and maternal infection. GBS is a commensal organism of the lower gastrointestinal and vaginal tract. A frequent mode of neonatal infection is vertical transmission from pregnant women to their foetus or neonate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival and biofilm production of 10 GBS strains in simulated vaginal fluid at pH 4.2, 5.5 and 6.5. GBS survived longer at higher pH than at normal vaginal pH. At pH 4.2, with the exception of two isolates that were recovered up to 48 and 72 h, viable GBS numbers declined below the limit of detection by 24 h. At higher pH, GBS survived between 3 and 15 days. All isolates investigated were biofilm producers but biofilm production was greater in tryptone soy broth compared to simulated vaginal fluid. The quantity of biofilm produced increased with the rise in the pH. This study suggests that high vaginal pH may influence both GBS survival and biofilm production and thus could be a risk factor for GBS infection.\n",
      "A call to arms for systematists: revitalising the purpose and practises underpinning the description of novel microbial taxa. \n",
      "\t Prokaryotic systematics is a fundamentally important discipline that provides a framework for the activities of all microbiologists. Here we propose that the field has become mired in a sea of perceived rules and regulations, many of which stipulate what is considered 'sufficient' for the phenotypic characterisation of novel prokaryotic taxa. Importantly, we argue also that the principles and practise of prokaryotic systematics have not yet fully embraced the revolution in biological understanding that has occurred through the availability of huge numbers of whole genome sequences. We therefore propose that a significant reappraisal of the procedures used to describe novel prokaryotic taxa is needed, including the likely introduction of new publication formats. Urgent action is needed to revitalise the practise of prokaryotic systematics in order to maintain this discipline as an attractive career choice for twenty first century life scientists.\n",
      "Verminephrobacter aporrectodeae sp. nov. subsp. tuberculatae and subsp. caliginosae, the specific nephridial symbionts of the earthworms Aporrectodea tuberculata and A. caliginosa. \n",
      "\t Clone library-based studies have shown that almost all lumbricid earthworm species harbour host-specific symbiotic bacteria belonging to the novel genus Verminephrobacter in their nephridia (excretory organs). To date the only described representative from this genus is Verminephrobacter eiseniae, the specific symbiont of the earthworm Eisenia fetida. In this study two novel rod-shaped, non-endosporeforming, betaproteobacterial symbionts were isolated from the nephridia of two closely related earthworm species. Both isolates were affiliated with the genus Verminephrobacter by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Similarly to V. eiseniae, the two isolates grew aerobically with a preference for low oxygen concentrations on a range of sugars, fatty acids and amino acids and fermentatively on glucose and pyruvate. These phenotypes match well with the conditions reported or inferred for the nephridial environment. Based on 16S rRNA gene similarity, DNA-DNA hybridization value and phenotypic characteristics the two isolates are clearly distinct from V. eiseniae. Phenotypic characteristics could not clearly differentiate the two strains as separate species but a low DNA-DNA hybridization value of 57.3%, their earthworm host specificity, differing temperature ranges and pH optima suggest that they represent two subspecies of a novel species of Verminephrobacter. For this species, the name V. aporrectodeae sp. nov. is proposed, with the two subspecies V. aporrectodeae subsp. tuberculatae (type strain, At4(T) = DSM 21361(T) = LMG 25313(T)) and V. aporrectodeae subsp. caliginosae (type strain, Ac9(T) = DSM 21895(T) = LMG 25312(T)) isolated from the nephridia of the earthworms Aporrectodea tuberculata and A. caliginosa, respectively.\n",
      "Systematics of prokaryotes: the state of the art. \n",
      "\t The term taxonomy is often used synonymously with systematics but it should be regarded more as a specific part of the latter and comprises the orderly arrangements of (defined) units in addition to the nomenclature, i.e. labelling of these units defined by classification, and also identification of these units defined by classification and labeled by nomenclature. Similar to all biological disciplines, taxonomic approaches in microbiology aim at the establishment of a system that mirrors the \"order in nature\" as closely as possible with the ultimate goal to describe the whole evolutionary order back to the origin of life. With the recognition of molecular markers present in all organisms (here in particular the small subunit rRNAs, ssRNSs), the achievement of this goal has become more and more feasible and the generation of gene and increasing numbers of genome sequences allow nowadays the generation of large amounts of data and often a very detailed insight into the genetic potential of prokaryotes. The possibility to generate whole genome sequences in a very short period of time leads to a strong tendency to base the taxonomic system more and more on sequence data. However, a comprehensive understanding of all the information behind sequence data is lagging far behind their accumulation. Genes and genomes may (or may not) function only in a given \"environment\", with the cell as basic entity for the display of this potential. Prokaryotic taxonomy still has its focus on the whole organism. In this context, natural selection drives evolution selecting the existing phenotypes and it is the phenotype that \"exhibits\" this process both in a given cellular and also environmental context. The term polyphasic taxonomy, which was coined almost 40 years ago and aimed at the integration of many levels of information (from molecular to ecological data) thereby allowing a more holistic view, should be revisited in the light of the enormous potential of the novel information associated with large data sets.\n",
      "The physiological characteristics of the yeast Dekkera bruxellensis in fully fermentative conditions with cell recycling and in mixed cultures with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. \n",
      "\t The yeast Dekkera bruxellensis plays an important role in industrial fermentation processes, either as a contaminant or as a fermenting yeast. In this study, an analysis has been conducted of the fermentation characteristics of several industrial D. bruxellensis strains collected from distilleries from the Southeast and Northeast of Brazil, compared with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was found that all the strains of D. bruxellensis showed a lower fermentative capacity as a result of inefficient sugar assimilation, especially sucrose, under anaerobiosis, which is called the Custer effect. In addition, most of the sugar consumed by D. bruxellensis seemed to be used for biomass production, as was observed by the increase of its cell population during the fermentation recycles. In mixed populations, the surplus of D. bruxellensis over S. cerevisiae population could not be attributed to organic acid production by the first yeast, as previously suggested. Moreover, both yeast species showed similar sensitivity to lactic and acetic acids and were equally resistant to ethanol, when added exogenously to the fermentation medium. Thus, the effects that lead to the employment of D. bruxellensis in an industrial process and its effects on the production of ethanol are multivariate. The difficulty of using this yeast for ethanol production is that it requires the elimination of the Custer effect to allow an increase in the assimilation of sugar under anaerobic conditions.\n",
      "Phylogenetic study of the species within the family Streptomycetaceae. \n",
      "\t Species of the genus Streptomyces, which constitute the vast majority of taxa within the family Streptomycetaceae, are a predominant component of the microbial population in soils throughout the world and have been the subject of extensive isolation and screening efforts over the years because they are a major source of commercially and medically important secondary metabolites. Taxonomic characterization of Streptomyces strains has been a challenge due to the large number of described species, greater than any other microbial genus, resulting from academic and industrial activities. The methods used for characterization have evolved through several phases over the years from those based largely on morphological observations, to subsequent classifications based on numerical taxonomic analyses of standardized sets of phenotypic characters and, most recently, to the use of molecular phylogenetic analyses of gene sequences. The present phylogenetic study examines almost all described species (615 taxa) within the family Streptomycetaceae based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and illustrates the species diversity within this family, which is observed to contain 130 statistically supported clades, as well as many unsupported and single member clusters. Many of the observed clades are consistent with earlier morphological and numerical taxonomic studies, but it is apparent that insufficient variation is present in the 16S rRNA gene sequence within the species of this family to permit bootstrap-supported resolution of relationships between many of the individual clusters.\n",
      "Microbial systematics in the post-genomics era. \n",
      "\t Microbial systematics and phylogeny should form the foundation and guiding light for a comprehensive understanding of different aspects of microbiology. However, there are many critical issues in microbial systematics that are currently not resolved. Some of these include: how to define and delimit a prokaryotic species; development of rationale criteria for the assignment of higher taxonomic ranks; understanding what unique properties distinguish species from different groups; and understanding the branching order and interrelationship among higher prokaryotic clades. The sequencing of genomes from large numbers of cultured as well as uncultured microbes covering prokaryotic diversity provides unique means to achieve these important objectives. Prokaryotic genomes are found to be very diverse and dynamic and horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) are indicated to have played important role in species/genome evolution. Although HGT adds a layer of complexity in terms of understanding the genomes and species evolution, it is contended that vast majority of genes and genetic characteristics that are distinctive characteristics of higher prokaryotic taxa are vertically inherited and based on them a solid foundation for microbial systematics can be developed. We describe two kinds of molecular markers consisting of conserved indels in protein sequences and whole proteins that are specific for different groups that are proving particularly valuable in defining different prokaryotic groups in clear molecular terms and in understanding their interrelationships. The genetic and biochemical studies on these taxa-specific molecular markers also open the way to discover novel biochemical and physiological characteristics that are unique properties of these groups.\n",

      "\t Sedimentary environments in the Arctic are known to harbor diverse microbial communities playing a crucial role in the remineralization of organic matter and associated biogeochemical cycles. In this study, we used a combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches to understanding the bacterial community composition associated with the sediments of a terrestrial versus fjord system in the Svalbard Arctic. Community-level metabolic profiling and growth response of retrieved bacterial isolates towards different carbon substrates at varying temperatures were also studied to assess the metabolic response of communities and isolates in the system. Bacterial species belonging to Cryobacterium and Psychrobacter dominated the terrestrial and fjord sediment retrievable fraction. Amplicon sequencing analysis revealed higher bacterial diversity in the terrestrial sediments (Shannon index; 8.135 and 7.935) as compared to the fjord sediments (4.5-5.37). Phylum Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominated both terrestrial and fjord sediments. Phylum Verrucomicrobia and Cyanobacteria were abundant in terrestrial sediments while Epsilonbacteraeota and Fusobacteriia dominated the fjord sediments. Significant differences were observed in the carbon substrate utilization profiles between the terrestrial and fjord sediments at both 4 °C and 20 °C incubations (p < 0.005). Utilization of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, D-mannitol and Tween-80 by the sediment communities and bacterial isolates from both systems, irrespective of their temperature incubations implies the affinity of bacteria for such substrates as energy sources and for their survival in cold environments. Our results suggest the ability of sediment bacterial communities to adjust their substrate utilization profiles according to condition changes in the ecosystems and are found to be less influenced by their phylogenetic relatedness.\n",
      "Chemostat enrichment and isolation of Hyphomicrobium EG. A dimethyl-sulphide oxidizing methylotroph and reevaluation of Thiobacillus MS1. \n",
      "\t A stable mixed bacterial culture was obtained by chemostat enrichment using dimethyl-sulphoxide as a carbon and energy source. This culture could not only rapidly oxidize dimethyl-sulphoxide but also dimethyl-sulphide. Enzyme determinations indicated that an important part of it consisted of methylotrophs, which assimilated carbon via the serine pathway. Indeed plate counts revealed the majority of the community to be a Hyphomicrobium species. This organism, designated Hyphomicrobium EG, is an obligate methylotroph which can only grow aerobically on several different C1-compounds. Its performance on dimethyl-sulphoxide was compared with that of the community and of another recently isolated strain, Hyphomicrobium S. The mixed culture, Hyphomicrobium EG and Hyphomicrobium S had a mu max of 0.08, 0.08 and 0.014 h-1 respectively. The KS for dimethyl-sulphoxide was the same for all three cultures (3-6 microM), whereas that for dimethyl-sulphide of Hyphomicrobium EG after growth on dimethyl-sulphoxide was 3-fold higher than that of the other two cultures (48 and 16 microM respectively). After growth on dimethyl-sulphide it improved to 3 microM. Dimethyl-sulphide respiration was maximal at a concentration of 100 microM; higher concentrations were inhibitory. One of the accompanying organisms, a pink methylotroph, was able to derive energy from the oxidation of thiosulphate. Available cultures of Thiobacillus MS1 that were reported to be able to utilize dimethyl-sulphide could no longer metabolize this compound.\n",
      "The respiratory activities of four Hansenula species. \n",
      "\t The respiratory activities and the cytochrome spectra from four species belonging to the genus Hansenula have been analysed. The results obtained and described in this paper show that H. glucozyma possesses only the primary, antimycin A-sensitive respiration, H. anomala and H. californica possess primary and secondary (salicylhydroxamate-sensitive) respirations, whereas H. saturnus possesses three respiratory activities (AA-sensitive, SHAM-sensitive, and AA + SHAM-insensitive). The respiratory activity of H. glucozyma is glucose-repressible, whereas the activities of the other species are not. In addition, antimycin A (AA) and erythromycin (ERY) in the culture media differently inhibit the growth of the four species and regulate the respiratory pathways in the species analysed.\n",

      "\t Ocotea odorifera is a medicinal plant that is popularly known in Brazil as \"canela-sassafrás\" and is used to treat dermatosis. This study investigated the antifungal properties of O. odorifera. The methanol extract of O. odorifera was submitted to successive chromatographic separation and yielded Tellimagrandin II (TEL). Candida parapsilosis strain ATCC 22019 was used to determine the minimum inhibitory (MIC) and fungicidal concentrations, and to study the synergistic action with nystatin (NYS), amphotericin (AMP), and fluconazole (FLU). After treatment, the morphology of the yeast was analysed by scanning electron microscopy. Cytotoxicity was assessed in Vero cells, and genotoxicity by the micronucleus test. The TEL structure was proposed based on NMR and comparison with literature data and ESI-MSMS analysis. The compound showed potent inhibitory activity against C. parapsilosis, with a MIC of 1.6 μM. TEL acted synergistically with NYS, AMP, and FLU, and caused morphological alterations in the yeast cells. The methanolic extract showed low cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo, and was not mutagenic in mice (P < 0.05). The use of O. odorifera in traditional medicine seems to have a valid basis, in view of the antifungal activity of TEL demonstrated in this study, and may contribute to potential drug development.\n",
      "Past, present and future research directions with Pichia anomala. \n",
      "\t The first International Pichia anomala Symposium provided a survey of past, recent and ongoing research on this yeast. The research community working with this yeast has focussed on several areas. Based on molecular data, a revision of the taxonomy is required: the name P. anomala is no longer applicable, as the genus Pichia is polyphyletic. The current debate centres on whether the yeast should be designated as Wickerhamomyces anomalus or if the previous name, Hansenula anomala, should be re-instated. The anti-microbial activities of this yeast received considerable attention during the symposium. H. anomala has been extensively studied as a biopreservation agent in many different post-harvest systems. Several mechanisms account for its anti-microbial activities, including the production of killer proteins and toxic volatile metabolites. Anti-idiotypic antibodies generating an \"internal image\" of a killer protein have been found to possess therapeutic activity against a broad range of microorganisms. A great diversity of H. anomala strains was reported at the symposium. Strains have been isolated from several food and feed systems and even from the intestine and reproductive organs of a malaria vector (Anopheles stephensi). Feed and food supplemented with certain H. anomala strains show an improved quality due, for example, to the addition of advantageous proteins and phytase activity. However, a number of apparent opportunistic pathogenic strains have also been isolated. Strain differentiation, especially the recognition of potentially pathogenic isolates, is an important challenge for the future commercialisation of this yeast. Future industrial and agricultural application of this yeast also raises questions of the economics of large-scale production, its survival during storage (formulation) and of safety regulations, all of which require further investigation.\n",
      "Similarity of rpoB gene sequences of sucrose-fermenting and non-fermenting Corynebacterium diphtheriae strains. \n",
      "\t During the last decades, the majority of Brazilian Corynebacterium diphtheriae isolates were shown to be capable to metabolize sucrose, sometimes leading to erroneous identification as a non-diphtheric Corynebacterium species. The sequencing of the polymorphic region of the RNA polymerase beta subunit-encoding gene (rpoB) is an important taxonomic tool for identification of corynebacteria. The present study aimed to investigate the rpoB gene polymorphic features of sucrose-fermenting and non sucrose-fermenting strains. The results showed that sucrose-fermenting strains presented rpoB gene polymorphic regions with more than 98% similarity with the sequences deposited in the gene bank corresponding to non sucrose-fermenting strains. Data indicate that sucrose-fermenting isolates may act as a variant of C. diphtheriae biotype mitis. In addition we alert that sucrose-fermenting strains should not be discarded as contaminants mainly in countries where the possibility of isolation of this variant is higher.\n"
